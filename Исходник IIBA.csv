This was the overall theme of ING Bank online magazine The View, issue 8.  The request was for an animated infographic that explores the effect of demographic and social change on the workplace, education, society, the economy and companies. It’s title: ‘Seven facts that could define our future’. The challenge The first challenge was in finding a common denominator for these 7 pieces of information. 1- An aging workforce 2- Flexibility of working hours 3- A divided society due to inequality of wealth 4- The effect of automation and AI on jobs 5- New education and skills needed for the workplace 6- New business models 7- Changing demographics (aging) and its effect on healthcare The second was that this client wanted to use photography to illustrate the information. (We already established this as a ‘preferred’ style over the years.) And the final challenge was a limited budget. The concept: The most common denominator was ‘people’. (But I didn’t want to use people.) Through the use of ‘ants’ I was able to portray people/society in general. Ants are known for their social structure and working relationship. Their size was a plus in being able to use few props to convey the different pieces of information without distorting the size relation of components. Animation also offered an opportunity in giving focus to the data through the use of ‘pie’ like charts on almost all of the information. Less is more: I believe the less ‘stuff’ you bring into the visual helps give importance to what you do decide to show. In this case, I wanted to be as abstract and simple as possible since most of the information was unrelated. Conclusion: This was the first time ING Wholesale Banking used an animated infographic for ‘The View’. I was thrilled to be able to use the knowledge I received from the ‘Information is Beautiful’ workshop, and especially pleased the client agreed to try animation for the first time. The results support the usage of animation. The infographic was one of the best performing pieces of content in ‘The View’ with over 4k visits on the website and an average dwell time of 2m19s, which is extremely high. Global impact was huge as it was visited by 78 different countries. A win win situation: Not only was I able to have ‘free range’ on creativity, (something that is not normal for the banking sector), but this infographic gave the client reason to continue using animated infographics in the future.

This opened up a whole industry for printers-scholars, type cutters, and finally, a place solely for the creation of typography, the type foundry. This timeline tracks the type industry from the birth of the printing industry in 1456. Printers are included as they create their own type. It was only until 1540 that the gradual specialization of labor allowed Claude Garamond (the celebrated typographer) to open the type foundry. Traditional metal type foundries continue to grow and improve with technological advancements. Starting form the 1700s, individual type foundries joined to form large type design companies that dominated the field. They all collapsed at the start of the digital age, giving space to a whole new digital generation of type foundries.

The fully responsive web application and two native AR iOS and Android apps let people create data sculptures made of balancing rocks that represent ideas, concepts, movements they are hopeful for.   While experimenting with how data visualization can look like and behave in augmented reality, we are also implicitly letting people create their own frame of reference before letting them look at data. Building Hopes reminds us that working with data doesn’t necessarily mean illustrating the one and only truth on a topic, but most of the times it simply means providing access to information that can be interpreted in many different, maybe also contrasting, ways.

From a total of more than 45700 recorded meteorite landings only around 3800 have a mass larger than 1 kg. This interactive visualization is about this group of meteorites and it's based on a dataset from ""The Meteorolitical Society"". Meteorites which have been observed while they transited the atmosphere or impacting the earth are called ""falls"" while all other are called ""finds"". Furthermore, meteorites can be divided into three big groups: stony meteorites which are rocks, iron meteorites and stony-iron meteorites which contain both metallic and rocky material. Very special cases are a few meteorites which come from the Moon and Mars. Through the visualization's interface it's possible to filter all these different kinds of meteorites and it's possible to explore the meteorites in terms of geographical location and time. The ""geographical exploration"" tell us that most meteorites have been found in highly populated areas. It's easy to suspect that there are probably much more meteorites which have not been found yet. The exploration in time show us, for instance, that there has been a gradual increment in the amount of found meteorites with a highest point around 2000. You could think that there has been a meteor storm during that period, however when isolating these years in the timeline, the map show different groups of meteorites which have been found in areas where organized search has taken place. Macrometeorites is the winning entry of Visualizing.org's ""Visualizing Meteorites"" Challenge (June 2013)."	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Interactive Visualization

This time must be taken from an existing activity. After all, there is a fixed number of minutes during the day. Where do parents usually draw from? In the same spirit of looking at time use for working adults over all of adulthood, I counted the hours for people with one child under 18 in the house and compared the totals against those without a child in the house. For simplicity’s sake, I focused on employed people from age 25 to 43 (25 is the average age Americans have their first kid), and the comparison below shows differences for the same time span. Between the age 18 to 43, a parent with one child spends 9,572 more hours caretaking than someone without a child in the house and 1,468 more hours on household work. These hours are pulled mostly from socializing, relaxing, and work.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Unusual

At times like this, when news develops quickly, the NOS newsroom works at full speed to cover everything on every platform. The NOS news app is filled with fast news and live coverage, but it can be hard for readers to summarize the events. Therefore, a team of two journalists and three designers created a visual summary that takes the viewer through the events in less than two minutes. The reconstruction was made by combining photos and videos made after the event with imagery from before, also of the venue itself. The collaboration between journalists, working on texts, and designers, doing the visual research, resulted in quick visual journalism. In fact, this visual summary of the Manchester attack was made in less than six hours and was one of the first visual summaries to come online.

We analyzed and mapped U.S. Forest Service data that weighs 65 wildfire risk factors – topography, precipitation, vegetation, previous fires, among many others – and rates each 18-acre parcel nationwide for fire hazard. This is where most journalistic investigations of the topic typically end. But because of what we saw in Paradise, California's deadly 2018 blaze, we went further. We used Census data to identify smaller, more-vulnerable communities, measured each community's evacuation routes, and found the age of its residents, the share with disabilities, percentage of mobile homes, and participation in the cellular emergency alert system. We did this for about 5,000 communities across 11 states. The challenge was to present the wealth of findings based on this complex analysis – that 526 small communities across the region faced a wildfire potential greater than Paradise – in a way that readers would easily understand. Combining graphics with traditional storytelling allowed readers to comprehend complex ideas before diving into deep analysis. We also built a lookup page that lets users examine any community for themselves. The visuals themselves represent an interesting use of design and technology in the service of journalism. We used code to recreate and verify the analysis, aiding early visualization and prototyping. These rough representations were refined by hand, and then rendered again using code. These graphics were then imported into an animation and finalized before being exported as scalable vector graphics and controlled by code in the browser. By combining these layers, we were able to take advantage of the diverse skills of many team members while communicating clearly to our readers.

In Australia, the report is prepared every five years by an independent team of expert authors. The report examines various aspects of Australia’s environment; the impacts of current pressures and management approaches; and the outlook for the future. Biotext developed a series of infographics to explain key ideas and complex concepts in the report. One of the key infographics we developed was about how cumulative pressures on the environment create a ‘tipping point’ beyond which an environment cannot survive or is permanently changed. In general, a single environmental pressure, such as sediment flow onto a coral reef, can be managed or simply survived. However, pressures start to accumulate and inter-react – for example sediment clouds water and higher temperatures place pressure on corals – the environment can degrade to a point of no return. Together with the authors and our design team, we went through a number of ideas to generate the final solution, which was surprisingly simple. The visualisation uses a Venn diagram applied to the natural environment. We altered the traditional ‘circle’ layout for the Venn diagram, because the traditional layout generally creates a small overlapping center part, which creates difficulties in adjusting text to fit. We also wanted to provide physical examples of the environments, to contextualise the problem. Once we had created the first concept in ‘Cumulative pressures amplify the threat to the environment’, we knew that it was successful because we could immediately see applications in explaining other environmental pressures. The central Venn concept was therefore used in various ways in the report to explain issues facing particular environments. For example, the cumulative pressures on giant kelp forests infographic summarises a key pressure on marine environments. Kelp forests are a vital marine habitat. These forests are already under pressure from natural pressures, such as sea urchins which eat kelp and variations in sea temperature which influence where kelp can grow. Kelp forests have adapted to cope with a balance of these natural pressures. But human activities add new pressures and exacerbate the current pressures, such that the cumulative effect is the destruction of the original environment and the creation of ‘urchin barrens’. Similarly, in the coastal infographic we wanted to show how the cumulative effects of climate change (including sea level rise and increased storm frequency) interacted with population growth and development to ‘squeeze’ costal environments.

41	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1076-good-eggs	Good Eggs	Big Group and Baker Wilcox	For Easter, we produced a graphic that celebrated nature's most interesting eggs. Taking examples from species of bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, insect, arachnid, mollusc, crustacean and even mammal, we presented what we felt represented the most interesting examples of eggs in the world. Research was extensive and was mostly done in the old fashioned way - looking through books. The availability and diversity of egg diagrams online is strangely lacking, so while it made it necessary to seek out books, we like to think our infographic is addressing the dearth of egg illustration online in some small way. From a design point of view, we wanted to achieve some symmetry and to arrange the eggs so as to provide an immediate visual impact. The main challenge was scale: the largest bird eggs are many times larger than the smallest insects'. We got round this by working in 2 scales, reducing the larger eggs and magnifying the smaller ones, indicated by the colour of the text and a key.

The city has been actively researching, developing and rolling out many new initiatives and services to ensure citizens have access to information. The Contracts Portal was one of these research projects and was developed by FFunction to enable citizens to understand where the city’s money goes, how the money is distributed, and who the largest contractors in the City of Montreal happen to be. FFunction proposed a treemap structure for exploring the contracts, giving users the ability to easily see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other modes of representation. A second advantage of using a treemap to represent this data is that they make efficient use of space. As a result, hundreds of items can be displayed on the screen simultaneously. This is ideal for mapping a whole contracting landscape, allowing citizens to search for the most costly contracts and largest suppliers of the City. Users have many filter options to sort and view the data, allowing for a high degree of flexibility in how the material is presented.

49	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3758-a-map-of-economics-and-suicide	A Map Of Economics And Suicide	University of Edinburgh	There is a big problem in economics regarding tragedy, as in this field someone's pain is normally reduced to a figure for commensuration, here I would like to address that. Most people find it difficult to discuss suicide. Sadly, this often happens only after suicide has happened to someone close, and self-immolation is not normally the route casual conversations go. It is definitely a serious matter, a phenomena that happens in every country, even in those where it is denied or openly frowned upon. Recent stats on suicide have provided of views on what may cause suicide, it is common to think that cold weather or lack of resources can lead someone to take their own life. This kind of generalization is dangerous as examples that counter them can easily be spotted once the data is properly analyzed. In this map I explore the relationship that several countries have had in te last decades between their reported stats of suicide, as per the World Health Organization, and their growth domestic product. Suicide is a taboo subject for governments and institutions, it is seldom considered a health issue and more often exclusively attached to cultural, religious, environmental and even economical causes. This interactive map aims to bridge the gap between the particularity of individual pain and the often cold-blooded world of national statistics. The map shows us the compared status quo of each country in regards of self-inflicted death and per capita growth domestic product. In shades of green, the level of saturation for each country describes their economical growth in the last 30 years. In shades from green to red we find circles for each country, these circles hold 3 pieces of information: 1. The color from green to red signal their Suicide Rate (number of suicides per 100,000 population), green is below world average and red over, and saturation is higher on the extremes. 2. The size of the circle relates to the average total deaths by suicide in the last 30 years. 3. Not an obvious one that needs inference. The overlay of these circles over the map shows us a relation between country size and suicide totals, sometimes small countries have high suicide rates, but geographically small populations mean they only have a few suicides per year, like Singapore. In countries with large extensions of land, suicide rate might not be as high, but yearly totals can reveal there's a widespread societal problem to tackle, this is the case of Russia. The users explore the data themselves through moving the sliders, and by visualizing them simultaneously the stats used here (WHO, World Bank), each user can find that the common factors we normally blame suicide on can play a part, but each country has many factors at play that make them complex in their own way. What I've found is that there's no best combination of factors, yet, we can find remarkable regional examples like the Mediterranean and Latin America, where low suicide figures are the norm.

In some regions of northern China, the loss was enormous. The public doubted if local officials had taken all precautions which could have prevented this loss. The goal of this reporting is to record and reflect on the often-unnoticed disasters: flooding is the most common disaster in China. However, the news and discussion on this is often overlooked in the post-truth era. The team therefore would like to record and reflect on the issues of this disaster. This is a multimedia explanatory reporting with various dataviz and infographics. It discussed the human impact on the flood vulnerability of the environment as well as the changes that have to be made in disaster management and relief service in response to rapid urbanization. Scientific explanations on why China is vulnerable to flood hazards are also included. Dataviz, Infographics and Other Elements: 1. Meteorological data from open data source is visualized on a map: on the rainfall map, each raining event in China is depicted as a simulated water droplet on a surface, with the diameter representing the precipitation amount and the colour gradient representing the frequency of rain in the particular district. 2. Historical data shown on graph to raise awareness: several data graphs included in the project to show that damage from flood disasters in China is extensive. And it should not be neglected in average years without massive flooding. 3. Virtual reality (VR) technology is used on the mobile version of the project, providing a more realistic representation of the flood event. 4. Photo essays, before-and-after aerial photography, and recap video are included to assist storytelling and enhance audience’s empathy.  A series of human stories as a prelude: this project combines retrospective and explanatory reporting, with the interviews on the field after the flood as the beginning. The human stories and the voices of the flood victims deserve to be heard. (Originally published in Chinese, then translated into English. Only Chinese version for the mobile version.)

South China Morning Post	This interactive project visualises publically available data and historical chronicles in the case of figureheads like William Wallace. The data visualisation by the South China Morning Post’s infographic designers, Marcelo Duhalde and Dennis Wong, is composed in the form of a bar chart to compare the heights of contemporary and historical world leaders chosen as being of interest to a Hong Kong readership. A colour key indicates which of the movers and shakers are alive or deceased. The composition is a visual reference to a police lineup. Politicians, Generals, heads of state and spiritual leaders from different epochs are arranged from shortest to tallest, left to right. Recent studies have controversially revealed taller people tend to receive bigger pay packets. The authors were curious how these charismatic, larger than life, world leaders, stacked up in terms of height compared to their national average. Readers are also invited to interact with the story by entering their own height and gender, metric and imperial options are provided. A gray silhouette representing the reader appears among the celebrities. By scrolling horizontally readers can go toe to toe with world leaders and compare them to their own height. It is a playful solution with instant results and is a formula that can be transposed into many scenarios allowing users to pit themselves against others in any number of scenarios. The portraits are simple vector drawings designed to not distract from the concept and data. A caricature of Joseph Stalin was used for the placeholder image as an example of a ruthless political leader demonstrating height doesn’t necessarily reflect a person’s power.

This map presents the Digital Humanities Conference 2019 through its authors, which are arranged according to their lexical distance. All the conference papers were collected and analyzed using Natural Language Processing methods. Then, authors are displayed according to their similarity. Computed keywords are visualized between each couple of authors, pointing out the most relevant term between them; zooming allows users to discover further keywords, which are hidden from a distant view to maintain readability. Finally, the elevation layer shows the density of articles; authors with many publications figure as peaks, representing the most influential scholars. This visual method is a powerful way to grasp the whole conference at one; the hope is that this map won’t be employed just as a retroactive way to reflect on past events, but rather as an instrument to prepare the visit and orientate the attendees during the conference.

We intuitively understand that what language we are born speaking, what religion we follow, and the color of our skin predetermine a very significant part of our lives and who we are. The goal is to use this intuition to learn more about different societies via these proxy variables and test if the complexity of each country correlates with its economic outcomes, political system, geographic location, religion, or level of moral freedom. We further employ a clustering algorithm and create a taxonomy that organizes the countries in our world by their shared complexity (heterogeneity vs homogeneity). As a result, a new world emerges, one in which our closest neighbors are not the ones sharing our borders but countries located thousands of miles away. The combined analysis and visualizations lead us to the conclusion that there is ultimately more that binds us than divides us.

The number of international migrants worldwide has continued to grow rapidly in recent years due to the development of modern transportation and technology. This phenomenon has deeply impacted and reformed the human economies, policies and society. There is no doubt that the world is on the move. Our team used the open database from the Department of Economic and Social Affairs at the United Nations and visualized it with a 3D-globe model. By rotating the 3D-globe model, you can directly discover the population Inflow and outflow of 232 countries or areas all over the world. The connections between different countries create a sense of movement. We added the character graphics to represent the large number of population movement. The changing colour of the line represented gender. Some interesting conclusions can also be found during your exploring. For instance, the largest number of international migrants resided in the United States, Germany and Russian; but for different reasons, respectively. In some countries, there are more immigrants than emigrants; In some countries, the situation is just the reverse. The migrant populations of different countries have different gender ratios.

Mennatullah Hendawy	How far does imaging the city in planning schools represent contextual urban realities? As a previous student and current practitioner of planning, I noticed two conflicting realities: the city as it is dealt with in Egyptian schools of planning especially at the undergraduate level, and the status quo of urban realities in Egypt. There is the city that is taught and planned in academic design studios in which everything appears formal, neat, and well-designed and there is the other city that is informal, lacks basic services, and some call it chaotic. There is the Academic City, constructed through the teachings in academia and there are the multiple, present lived cities, or what is referred to in this paper as everyday cities. This research is part of my cumulative PhD about the mediatization of urban planning at TU Berlin. It aims to investigate and ignite discussions about the kind of ‘city’ that planning students are exposed to in the process of becoming planning professionals and the purpose of the employed mediums/media in these processes. Although this research focuses on the case of planning education and communication in Egypt, by acknowledging that nowadays we live in a time that is characterized by being highly internationalized/globalized and mediatized (see Friedmann, 2005; 2012, Healy, 2012; Healy, 2013; Hepp 2013; McLuhan, et al., 1967; Watson, 2016), the findings of this research can contribute also to global planning discussions. In this sense, this study is not about contextual divisions but rather about global urban development in space, media, and time.  	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Humanitarian

ThePaper.cn / Sixth Tone	For this year QiXi Festival, the Chinese Valentine's Day, we wanted to see what young Chinese are curious about when it comes to love. We collected 1139 questions from Zhihu, the largest online Q&A community site in China. The original data is quite text-heavy, but to save our readers trouble from consuming overwhelming text content, we decided to create a main visualization to show the whole picture. On the visualization, we categorized all the questions into 11 types: why, when, how is, what is, will it, etc. The display of each type mimics a flower, which is a symbol of love under most conditions. Then, we highlight some high-frequency words on the pistils, like breaking up, find, pursue, judge, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. Readers can click each pistil to see what commonly asked questions are related to the keywords. After that, we analyzed the data from three perspectives: what questions about love do people ask most, what most popular answers are talking about, and what we can tell from the timing of answering and asking the questions. In addition to infographic charts, we also create some illustrations to make the layout more love-ly.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Longlist;People, Language & Identity

Renee Walker	Visual aids to help medical professionals understand the benefits, risks, and results of tests. The guides ask in visual language: What difference will it make in the patient's life? What is the likelihood of the disease given the patient's history? And what would a positive test mean? A warm/cold color contrast represents positive and negative results. The form of a dial is used to consider pretest probability, and two waffle charts compare the chance of a true-positive versus false-positive results based on the patient's background. An icon system helps doctors see at a glance what percentage of a test result is a true and false positive or negative.

People belonging to different age groups are seen hanging around in the square, most likely around the food stalls. The central courtyard, used for parking vehicles, is surrounded by a series of shops on the North, East and South. There are smaller food junctions towards the entrance, in the West, where the crowd is mainly seen. The market opens at 10 in the morning, but the crowd is seen only after 11 am. Students visit in the morning, while the officials visit in the noon. The actual business starts only in the evening. People start pouring in larger numbers as the sun hides below the horizon. The vendors have a great time selling goods till late at night and wrap up by 11pm of week days. Weekends are a boon to these vendors. The crowd on weekends is twice as much of that on weekdays and the market is open till 12 in the midnight. To understand the role of such public squares in a city, I observed both – tangible and intangible aspects of the place to represent them through maps. The below illustrated map is from the theme of mapping the movement of animals and birds The least considered and observed visitors are the animals and birds. This place has its own importance of birds and animals as localities take care of them. Squirrels are regular visitors and are fed by the shopkeepers every morning. The map illustrates the movement of Squirrels at its peak in the public square at early mornings when the human interference is minimum.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Unusual

Statistics on weather are everywhere: on TV, in newspapers, on our mobile phones. But weather is more than just abstract numbers—it influences and defines our life, day by day. Even if we live in highly urbanized metropoles, the forces of nature could bring our society to a stand still at anytime.  The Weather Radials not only tell the story of the four seasons of 2013 on a global scale—they also illustrate what it means to live in Reykjavík, Los Angeles or Seoul, all in one iconic visualization. Each city is presented as a unique radial visualization. Each radial illustrates the climatical characteristics of a specific city and points out the year’s unusual events in the local weather. For example, you can easily spot the unusually wet spring in Berlin, the prolonged heat wave in Washington, the record temperatures in Sydney and the monsoon season in Mumbai. Nearly a hundred hand-picked weather events highlight the stories behind the raw weather data: extreme weather conditions, temperature records, and other meteorological anecdotes of 2013.

Enter The Wonderwall. Designed with living data at its core, this experience is responsive to its surroundings and reactive to a range of data inputs: long range movement, voice and touch. At its heart is a powerful and flexible visual software tool that enables the creation of captivating data-led graphics and messaging in real-time. Unique to Intel and bespoke for the space, this cutting-edge, generative digital experience intersects art, technology and data. Data is no longer just a function of information. It’s a vibrant expression of connectivity and human interaction. The infinite stream of engaging, unexpected and reactive content gives invisible data a vivid and visible existence. The entrant has supplied multiple files for this work: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The Wonderwall enhances the HQ arrival experience by converting visitors from passive to active. It’s immediate and arresting, with constant content streams offering unique visuals to each visitor. The space itself has two large format digital ‘canvasses’, each with a different spatial characteristic and each requiring unique content feeds. ‘The Skylight’ is a huge five-sided screen arranged as an inverted cube and suspended just above head height. The ‘Storywall’ is an 8m long screen beside the main entrance – every visitor passes right next to this. A broad demographic of visitors passes through Intel’s lobby: C-suite executive customers on singular visits, thousands of staff on a daily basis, and even hundreds of children on school trips to the adjoining Intel museum. We’ve designed the software to modulate throughout the day to reflect the levels of foot traffic and to generate content that appeals on multiple levels whilst remaining simple, rewarding and playful. What really sets this experience apart is that it’s built to grow, adapt and aggregate. The generative nature means that the installation can be used to create “data vignettes” that celebrate/promote topical happenings such as a ‘Pride takeover’ and Intel’s 50th anniversary celebrations.

Super Kamiokande is a giant science experiment deep underground in Japan, searching for the origins of the universe by looking into the heart of dying stars. When Tokyo correspondent/video journalist Jake Sturmer and producer Yumi Asada secured extremely rare access to the huge underground tank, they and the Story Lab team engaged in extensive planning to ensure that their one-hour of access resulted in a piece of digital storytelling that could do justice to this spectacular scene. When the day came, Jake and Yumi had one shot to get this right - there would be no do-overs. Once lowered into the tank, they raced to capture it in photos and video using specialised equipment including a 360 camera and a Go-Pro. The colour of the massive lightbulb-like sensors was amazingly beautiful, and it was like nothing they had ever seen before. While snapping away, they wondered how could they capture this scale and convey the beauty of this place to the people who have never seen this? Story Lab had a vision for the digital story which would use Jake and Yumi's imagery to its full potential, as well as inform readers of the complicated science behind the experiment in a way that was fully understandable to our audience. The heart of this story's digital innovation is the use of the beautiful 360 imagery and video. The use of 360 degree footage allowed us to give the audience a sense of the scale of the space. We used complex 360 degree video production techniques to show the process of neutrino detection from within the space itself enhancing the sense of immersion. We used a combination of open source technology and bespoke code to get the 360 content working in browser. In order to draw people's attention to certain points in the environment without asking them to alternate between reading the story and manually navigating the space, we implemented reading progress-bound events that automatically shift the camera’s focus & position, and execute seamless scene transitions. The reading progress feedback was further utilised later in the story in order to step through an animated infographic, and allow the graphic to blend more seamlessly into the story’s canvas. We used these simple and beautiful animated infographics to explain the scientific processes visually. This was so successful that the Victorian Space Science Education centre now uses the supernova explanation from the piece as a part of its teaching curriculum. We started with a fascinating and complex story, used our rare access to capture original material in an innovative way, explained it with detailed yet simple-to-understand graphics and presented in an innovative new format. Quote from one audience member on twitter- ‘7.15am, morning coffee, taking in the morning's headlines, dutifully, reluctantly. Secret lair, hmm. ""This is a neutrino"". Suddenly, awe and wonder.

To explore these national changes, we analyzed census data from 1990, 2000, 2010 and the latest estimates from the 2016 five-year American Community Survey. We then measured the diversity of every county using a statistic called the multigroup entropy index and generated highly-detailed maps of race and segregation. We learned that while the country has seen a large increase in racial and ethnic diversity over the last 30 years, many communities still live in large isolation from each other. Using a sophisticated routine of scripts, we generated detailed maps of race in some of the largest U.S. cities. And with the help of Mapbox, we then generated an interactive map that let readers journey through any part of America and track the changes in diversity from 1990.

We also looked at every US president since George Washington to see how Trump fits in with his predecessors, both illustrious and infamous.

Through extensive data analysis, research and reporting, it finds that the careers that college-educated women take tend to differ from their male peers of the same degree attainment, and that those jobs pay less. It tackles a massive data set, analyzing layers of educational attainment, occupation, and income data from the American Community Survey’s five-year data release, to investigate a complex issue from multiple angles and offers substantive reasons for the phenomenon. The visuals and interactive elements of this piece are clear and extensive, making it easy to understand broad trends while also offering detail-oriented readers the opportunity to dive into the specifics of the data. For example, the graphics make it clear that female college graduates are much more likely to become social workers, counselors and teachers, whereas male college graduates are more likely to become computer programmers and professors. More curious readers, however, can also find that of the survey respondents, 343 math majors became secretaries or administrative assistants at an average salary of $40,000, with women making up 90 percent of that figure. It also provides readers the opportunity to “find themselves” in the data by seeking out their college majors and occupations and seeing the statistics behind them.

As much as people cared about and wrote about cryptocurrencies in their good days and bad days, little was done to make sense of cryptocurrencies in the context of traditional investments. We analyzed 16 months of action in digital tokens and traditional investments to shed light on how cryptocurrencies stack up. The graphics put cryptocurrencies in context of traditional classes, looking at their risk, return, trading volume, market value and initial offerings.

Now you have the chance to do the same thing again, but this time with a lot more coins belonging to one of the biggest coin collections in the world, the Münzkabinett Berlin! Every coin has its own history. It could even be that Alexander the Great or Caesar held them in their hands and spent them on their world changing wars! This tool gives you the chance to explore these coins and sort them through different layouts and filters. This visualization system represents a subset of the the numismatic collection using overview layouts that relate the material nature of the coins with their historical context. In the dynamic arrangements it becomes possible receive an impression of its total size and gain new insights by sorting the coins by different layouts. These layouts reminisce physical arrangements of coins that detest the rigid order of tables and grids. For example, coins can be placed into separate piles each representing a given metal type or country of origin. Another layout is a stream that visualizes the ebb and flow of coins that can be teased apart by another dimension such as coin type or country. The interface allows the viewer to play with the coins in a manner that would be unthinkable in the physical exhibition. Across all these arrangements the visualizations are made up of the images of the coins. When a parameter of the layout is changed all coins gradually rearrange themselves resulting in evocative transitions. The overall aim behind this research was to conceive alternative arrangements that do justice to the multidimensional and material abundance that the collection exhibits while providing a playful mode of access that is inviting to a lay audience. We undertook an iterative design process which consisted of visits to the physical museum as well as to the online database, co-creation activities such as a collaging workshop with numismaticians, and finally typical design methods such as sketching and prototyping interleaved with feedback sessions and evaluation.

245	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1665-the-data-divide-2-out-of-3-people-are-data-illiterate-and-why-you-should-care	The Data Divide: 2 out of 3 people are data illiterate (and why you should care)	Hill+Knowlton Strategies	The majority of Americans state that they trust data and are persuaded by claims supported by it. Yet, only one-third of the public is data literate. This creates a gap between the individuals becoming part of a new class of influencer — one whose power comes from data – and others who trust data without ever understanding it. The data influencers have the potential for more power than any previous generation of influencers.  The Transformation of Influence: How Data is Changing Attitudes and Decisions, is a comprehensive study of how longstanding mechanisms of influence are being disrupted by data, and how data impacts influence. This research is based on over 4,000 public interviews conducted in 2016 that were obtained through a 128-question online survey designed by Research Data+Insights. Through this report, Dr. Peter Zandan, Global Vice Chairman at Hill+Knowlton Strategies, and David May, Corporate CMO at AIG, present innovative and actionable recommendations on how corporations can use data effectively to communicate with the public.  Data is growing in influence for several reasons, including the rising availability of data, the reliance on the Internet for knowledge, and flourishing opportunities for connectivity and personalization. As a result, data is becoming a driving force in decision-making. The public is increasingly turning to data to decide anything from what news sources they should trust to whom they should vote for. Data is no longer just a collection of numbers on a page—it is a form of influence.  This research revealed an American public divided into four categories with respect to data. The first are the “data literate,” who self-reported an understanding of data in which conclusions can be drawn but without advanced statistical skills. The “data-savvy” audience is a subset of the literate who have participated in three to seven data-intensive projects in the past year. They are far more likely than the general public to rely on data when making decisions. “Data-influencers” are a subset of the data-savvy – just 6 percent of the population – who are both data savvy and also active in their communities, giving them the power to influence. Two-thirds of Americans, however, fall into the fourth category – the “data illiterate” – who do not meet the benchmark of data literacy.  While there is no one answer to bridging the data literacy gap, a three-pronged approach will help communicators meet the appetite for data-based storytelling across varying levels of data literacy. The first is to tell a data-based story to engage the data-savvy audience, coupled with an anecdotal side to appease the general public. The second is to identify the target audience and tailor the relevant data to their level of expertise. The third is to think in terms of data throughout the communications process.  One thing is clear about the implications of this research: Leaders in data-based messaging are three times more likely than stragglers to report a competitive advantage—74% vs. 24%. They are almost three times as likely to report revenue growth—56% vs. 20%. As digital tools become more and more entwined with everyday life, organizations will benefit from strengthening how they think about and use data to communicate across audiences.

282	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/932-left-behind	Left Behind	FFunction	Left Behind is the latest in a series of campaign-oriented data products created for UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Launched to coincide with International Women's Day 2015, Left Behind allows users to explore the education situation for girls worldwide before diving down to the classroom level in sub-Saharan Africa. Girls continue to lag behind boys in terms of education access, participation and outcomes. With compelling data visualization laid over evocative photos, the site aims to communicate a narrative that is clear enough for the general public while also providing solid data for journalists and researchers. Part of FFunction’s mandate was to ensure it was compelling visually to invite the user to explore, be easy to navigate, be easy to share on social media and to embed on 3rd party sites and blogs. The interactive has several pre-written tweets embedded, making it simple for users to share advocacy messages. Because the interactive was about being left behind, FFunction wanted to create visual contrast between the photos, the data and the narration. A key part of this was to show that real people are behind the numbers by using photos chosen from the World Bank’s library of images. Elements on the left-hand side provide data points of interest, and charts and data selectors are interactive to encourage exploration. Charts also point back to their original sources, both for transparency and to enable further research. Using integrated social sharing at every level of the interactive and the hashtag #leftbehind, the site encourages the public to request that policymakers devise a more effective plan to ensure the “Education for All” movement is met when the UN rewrites its Millennium Development Goals. Left Behind received retweets and social media interactions from high profile influencers including the Gates Foundation, Sue Desmond-Hellman, Global Partnership, and the United Nations. The main message here was simple to absorb and to share: without more investment in basic resources, new global commitments will be meaningless.

The physical and dynamic qualities of the charts are intended to draw people in to viewing data, differentiating them from screen-based visualisations that are beginning to lose their salience in our information-rich environments.

I decided to create a map of Iceland's Ring Road, the main tourist route across the island. I went to Iceland in the summer of 2017, and did a ton of planning to figure out what to see and what to do. The road loops and zigs and zags around the island, but is in effect a continuous loop. I wanted to create something that would be useful for a first time tourist, the kind of map I would have wanted for my trip. I took inspiration from metro system maps, which sometimes distort the geographic distance between stations in order to show the overall topology of the system itself. I found the experience of driving along the ring road to be analogous to a metro system: it's a series of stops along a continuous route. And it's called the ring road, so why not just make it a ring? I kept relative position and direction as much as possible (Vik is on the southern coast, Akureyri the north, and Reykjavik to the west), but distorted the shape of the island to conform to a perfect ring route shape. This proved to be a very tricky process, and required a lot of trial and error. But once I got it, I was surprised at how legible and recognizable the shape of Iceland still was.

The system that I created to visualize the total number of Spanish emigrations during this particular time-frame is reigned by four variables: time, quantity, destination and group of population. The system consist on a time line that is fragmented by year and mesures the volume of people that moves from Spain to another country in the world. That way we can perceive which type of emigration and its volume at any specific time (between 2008-2013) based on a particular destination. The people outflow is divided in two groups: nationals (Spanish born), represented in yellow, and internationals (non-Spanish born), represented in red. The destinations are organized upon geographical location and quantity of emigrations received, from high to low.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2015	Longlist;Data visualization

In one, people would see two characters randomly selected from a group of hundreds. And in the other one of two actors from the group of actors that appeared on three or more episodes. They then selected the character they liked more, or in the case of the performances, the performance they liked more. Forcing people to decide between two random options helps mitigate the impact of any vote stuffing, and we calculated these win percentages from 15,845 character matchup decisions and 20,972 actor matchup decisions.

For people with little understanding of economics a government department being cut by £5bn sounds sensational at first, but in reality that might only be a small portion of its budget. For our coverage to be truly transparent and engaging it was important for us to communicate not just how much money was being cut but also the context of this figure. We felt that the best way to do this was to use a separate pie chart to represent each department, this would then be fed live data and either increased or decreased to show how it would be affected by the cuts. The main focus for the project was The Wall of Pies, a wall sequence that showed a breakdown and explanation of which departments were being affected by the cuts. This was designed in Illustrator and built in VIZRT, with functionality a key part of the design process. We knew that the budget announcement and our reporting was never going to be a linear experience, so we gave the presenter complete control of what was being seen on The Wall of Pies via a tablet.

Being a fighting anime many battles take place during the 291 episodes. Characters get stronger through battles and training. A typical aspect of DBZ is that sudden increases of power can be unlocked through transformations, the different Super Saiyan levels being the most well known.

""Outdated and Unreliable: FEMA's Faulty Flood Maps Put Homeowners at Risk"" takes a sobering look at the underlying data that anchors the National Flood Insurance Program — a database of more than 23,000 maps that in some cases were last updated in the 1970s. The maps are used by more than 5 million Americans to insure $1.2 trillion worth of homes and businesses. But the program has come under enormous criticism in recent years. When Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in 2017, about 80 percent of the victims didn't have flood insurance. FEMA's flood maps had said they lived outside the high-risk floodplain, even as large portions of these homes saw flooding several times in just the last few years. Our story visualizes the impact of this misinformation on Houston homeowners and exposes large swaths of the country where flood maps are more than 40 years old, despite a federal law requiring maps be updated every five years. The piece diagrams how neighboring communities can produce drastically different flood map — a byproduct of what can happen when the surveying process becomes politicized by state and local officials. And additional charts and tables highlight the ultimate impact of bad flood map data — a federally-backed insurance program that’s $20 billion in debt. After the piece ran, data for more than 24,000 communities was made available on GitHub to encourage others to explore the accuracy of maps within their own communities. And finding from the piece were cited in a Congressional Budget Office report on the age of maps in communities prone to repeat flooding."

The New York City subway map is the one map that nearly everyone in the city consults constantly; it is posted at nearly every station entry and on every platform and subway car. The station names are a network of numbers and mostly men’s names and descriptives, but the map is an informational scaffolding on which other things can be built.

The numbers were pretty rough though. For example, to calculate the number of days spent sleeping during a lifetime, it was assumed that the average person sleeps eight hours per day, and then estimates just extrapolated for life expectancy. But sleep patterns change as you age. You start to sleep less as you get older. So I tried taking this into account using data from the American Time Use Survey. I still used averages, but I calculated averages for each year of life and then aggregated. Here’s what I got for adulthood (18 and older) — the time you’re presumably making your own choices.

399	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3992-nadi-kinetics-of-body-in-yoga	Nadi-Kinetics Of Body In Yoga	Timeblur Studio, Ather Energy	We took up this project to explore movement of body in a deterministic practice of Yoga. A particular sequence in Yoga, called Surya Namaskar or Sun Salutation, has been our starting point of enquiry. Surya Namaskar, is a sequence of 12 postures done first on right then on left. We appreciated the symmetry of this ancient system, where every 6th posture, the body experienced the least gravity, and every 1st and 12th Posture, it experienced the maximum gravity. Surya Namaskar is recommended to be done 8-12 rounds, slowly for spiritual benefits and quickly for physical benefits. In special cases, a daily practice of 108 rounds may be undertaken for purification. Why do we find the forms generated unusual? There is a sense of anthropomorphisation and a feeling of uncanniness in the forms generated. We see a face of woman and man when the form of Surya Namaskar is rotated by 90 degrees. The juxtaposition of a body in the flow of yogic sequence at the micro scale creates a web of complexities on a macro scale. The Surya Namaskar sequence provides an underlying structure, but what intrigued us the most is when the body form hides itself in the coherent formation of its flow and brings out uniqueness. The Data input to the form, is the motion data and color of the person performing Yoga. As a further exploration, we are adding other data parameters like breath and chakra (vortex energy) for every posture. To feed our creative urge, with Computer Vision and Creative Coding, we generated a time-freeze sculpture of Surya Namaskar from the data points of Surya Namaskar.

Data Obscura is our response to this current and pressing quest for truth. Multiple filters are applied to the information that we see: algorithms distil a world of opinions to give us a distinct view of events, and authenticity is becoming an increasingly scarce commodity. Over the last five years, at Signal Noise (data agency forming part of The Economist Group), we have curated self-initiated exhibitions which aim to explore themes, relevant not only to our peers, but also to the general public.  In June 2018, we explored the relationship between data and truth through a four-day ‘Data Obscura’ exhibition, launching with a panel event chaired by The Economist’s senior editor, Kenneth Cukier – which asked whether transparency and truth should be the ultimate aim online, and how much is ‘true enough’?  The eight projects ranged from data-driven storytelling, to design concepts for future digital products and services. We explored filter bubbles, algorithms, social media movements, fake news, or just plain old-fashioned not wanting to see counter-arguments. These are factors with the ability to refract, obscure, and challenge what we see, what we hear, and - ultimately - what we believe.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Unusual;Longlist

The rise of Uber is well documented, but the geographic complexity is often harder to see as the context and requirements of each area vary so quickly. Even within the confines of an airport the distinctions between Uber and Yellow Cabs can be seen. Uber data obtained via FOI request (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response) and Yellow Cab data available at https://nycopendata.socrata.com/. These are added to the image with a log-scale to bring out areas where there are clear differences. Uber pick-ups in green and Yellow Cab pickups in yellow. Red therefore is when the two pick-up densities are similar. Interestingly, artefacts from the interference in GPS position introduced by the tall buildings of Manhattan can be seen as some pick-up locations seem to be in the water.

The work focuses on identifying specific behaviors of Nano, Micro, and Macro plastic particles when that are dynamically affected by currents, wind, and temperature. The work has been developed through the intense use of scientific data, remote sensing, Ai - machine learning algorithms, coding and state of the art simulation. The title »Multiscale Flow map« refers to its strategic role, the structure as well as subject matter. Where multiple operational, spatial and temporal scales are relationally linked and where change on a small scale affects, alters or promotes behaviors of a larger system and vice versa. The Multi-Scale Flow Map is the convergence point of larger project that I developed on all stages from conception to research, collection of more than 900000000 real data points, 1000 hours of simulation, processing, and visualization that resulted in production of 365 Multi-Scale Maps and the final 4000mm x 4000mm large, ultra high-resolution MSFM that is exhibited at the 2018 Venice Biennale Exhibition.

The number of mutations found in tumors has been associated with overall survival of lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. Inspired by these findings, we developed a 3D information visualization that illustrates this association. It particularly shows patients’ overall survival (y-axis) versus the number of mutations (x- and z-axis); the wire balls and vertical strings represent the patients and their overall survival, respectively. This small prototype mirrors the 3D information visualization structure in terms of data and materials used. First, the wire balls are color-coded based on the smoking status (black for current or former smokers and blue for non-smokers). Second, the two blocks at the top of each wire ball represent race (yellow for Asians, black for African Americans, and white for Caucasians) and gender (purple for Females and light blue for Males). Third, the blue wire cover represents patient’s overall survival, the black wire cover signifies a death event, and the white wire cover indicates that the patient was still alive when data was collected.

In the midst of many alarmist stories about life in Sweden, it is understandable that many wonder how segregated and diverse Swedish cities are? Researchers tend to measure segregation by indices such as dissimilarity index, but their interpretation may be difficult to grasp for someone new to them. To help visualise residential segregation of foreign-born residents, I created a tool that allows exploring changes in neighbourhoods between 1990-2010. We see that patterns and scale of segregation are slightly different for each city. Contrary to popular belief, Swedish cities are quite integrated, especially when compared to the United States. Yet, for some neighbourhoods we can see a pattern where they are increasingly inhabited by foreign-born residents, in particular those born in non-Western countries.

In order to adapt to the life habits of different birds, the ornamental cage can be roughly divided into grain and insect feeding cage according to the species of birds. There are canary cage, yellow bird cage, wenbirdcage, lark cage, hydrangea cage and so on, insect cage has thrush cage, point chin cage, myna cage and so on. In addition, there are also suitable breeding cockatoo cage and various kinds of habitat. A birdcage is the main environment for the ornamental birds to live and play. Bird cage culture is a part of traditional Chinese culture, it represents a side of the historical landscape, reflecting the life of the ancestors at an exciting point. After the royal family came to Beijing, the wind of raising birds rose among the nobles because they were missing their hometown birds. Especially in the middle of the qing dynasty, in the rich economic and cultural background, the caged birds became a true portrayal of the playboy. As a result, raising birds gave birth to the production and processing of birdcages, some of which were made to perfection. The process of making birdcages reached its peak in the reign of emperor qianlong. At that time, the qing palace building office organized national skilled artisans, specially for the palace bird cage, its artistic value reached the highest level. So, under the influence of the royal family, people all over the country followed suit, raising birds to play in cages.

The documentary record of life in New South Wales is now, more than ever, digital. To showcase the library’s efforts in managing the archive of public social media about life in the state, the library partnered with CSIRO’s Data61 group, the data science wing of Australian’s publically funded science organisation. The archive data is collected using Data61’s social media analysis tool, Vizie, which collects public data from multiple platforms (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook Public Pages). A joint team from the library and Data61 co-designed a web application to allow the general public to interact with the archive. This application consists of two user interfaces. The first is a “Live” interface, which provides a real-time view of the collection process. The second is an “Explorer” interface, which allows interested users to sift through aggregate statistics generated from historical data. The Live (real-time) interface, the principle submission to this award, is immediately available as the landing page to this web-application. Its exhibition-style non-interactive display fosters conversations about the collecting of social media and life in New South Wales. It contains with two circular time-pieces designed to reflect the changing contents and emotions found in the online public discussions about life in the Australian state of New South Wales. The left timepiece, “Collection Activity”, is content-based and is designed to reflect the categories of the library’s social media collecting framework. The visualisation rotates through each of the nine top-level categories, such as “Arts”, “Environment”, “Indigenous”, and “Politics”, and provides a word cloud visualisation to display the last two hours’ worth of content for these subjects. These word clouds contain the online language about salient events used by the people in New South Wales and represents a snapshot of what is important at the current time. The inner rings indicate subcategories and also their relative volume. Complementing the content-based visualisation, the right side displays an “Emotion (Flower) Clock”. The clock resets each hour but as time passes, each of the sixty petals represents a minute and is coloured according to the proportions of emotion-based content for all data retrieved during that minute. We use an emotion-based dictionary to tag social media posts according to six primary emotions: Fear, Anger, Sadness, Love, Joy and Surprise. The “Explorer” interactive interface, allows one to drill into the aggregate statistics. By default, a week’s worth of content is presented. One can click on the histogram bars for the charts for activities or social media type to refine the dataset being viewed. For the dataset in focus, the interface presents the top emotions, hashtags, and keywords detected. Geotagged content is displayed in the map of NSW and greater Sydney. Of note are the top shared news articles during this week. This is another representation of what people in the State found interesting.

These statements reflect different views regarding the effectiveness and future use of “stop, question and frisk” policing tactics that allow police officers to stop civilians whom police officers deem reasonably suspicious and subsequently, frisk, search, or detain them, even through the use of physical force. The three images in this submission adapt and use a dynamic visualization environment I have developed and call the Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS) to visualize data about New York City’s Stop & Frisk Program. Together, the primary goal of these images is to provide new ways for the public to view and discuss New York City’s Stop & Frisk Program.

469	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/4198-flowers-of-the-sky	Flowers Of The Sky	Superposition	Dutch conductor and musician Krijn Koetsveld is artistic lead of classical vocal ensemble Le Nuove Musiche. Together they constantly seek out confrontations between past and present. Their most recent accomplishments has been to record all nine books of their favorite musician Claudio Monteverdi's (1567-1643) madrigals - the first ensemble in the world to do so. Having commissioned the building of a new harpsichord, Koetsveld sought out Superposition to design the visual ornament applied on the harpsichord. We mirrored Le Nuove Musiche's ambition to produce encounters between past and present by setting out to draw parallels between Monteverdi's and Koetsveld's lives. Though Koetsveld was born four centuries after Monteverdi, the two lives are connected by cycles of nature. Monteverdi lived during the late Renaissance. In our search for connecting cycles we discovered that during this period the commonly held belief was that comets were signs of the gods. It was not until the start of the seventeenth century that scientists started to prove comets were not in fact signs of coming disaster. Where comets used to be referred to as Flowers of the Sky, it slowly became clear these flowers were actually relatively small solar system bodies. Today, this once feared phenomenon is studied by space agencies such as NASA using high tech sensors and optics, resulting in immense amounts of highly accurate data describing these comets. Using this data, we designed and programmed a bouquet of four unique data visualizations that draw parallels between both lifespans. Each visualization uncovers information about comets that both Claudio Monteverdi and Krijn Koetsveld might have seen from Earth during their respective lives. Together, the visualizations form an alternative timeline that connects the two musicians. Periodic Sightings (outside) This arc diagram consists of a timeline that show Monteverdi's life on the far left and Koetsveld's life on the far right. On the outside of the harpsichord it shows those comets that both musicians may have seen during their time on Earth, how often they have appeared in the mean time, and how long it will take for them to return. Circumstances of Discovery (inside) This chord diagram visualizes who first discovered each comet, from which location on the planet they did so, and in which year the discovery was made. Orbital Period (inside) Comets travel along the same elliptical path constantly, and because they do so at a constant velocity they return to the same place in the solar system periodically. This interval is called a comet's periodicity, and it is unique to each comet. This visualization uses dashed lines to chart each comet's periodicity and sorts the comets on their Orbital Period. Apparent Magnitude (inside) When we gaze up at the night sky, every object in it seems to glow. The combination of the brightness of an object and its distance to the viewer is called the apparent magnitude. This diagram shows the relative apparent magnitude of various comets.

This full-page infographic uses data to visualise one such tale. According to folklore, a Chinese emperor from ancient times gave his chief eunuch a three-month deadline to plan the world’s most magnificent tower, or face execution. Thinking none of his plans are up to par he gives up in despair and on his final night decides to build a cage for his beloved pet cricket instead. When the emperor claps eyes on the cricket cage he is overwhelmed by its aesthetic beauty and immediately orders the Forbidden City’s watchtowers be built according to the same design. Marco Hernadez’s graphic visualisation for the South China Morning Post dissects one of the four Forbidden City watchtowers to showcase the sophisticated architectural practises of ancient times. Hernandez shows how buildings were constructed without the use of nails or glue to withstand earthquakes and last hundreds of years. Multiple ‘dougong’ brackets, for instance, are added to the tops of columns where the weight of the roof compresses the joints and distributes the weight evenly throughout the structure. Hernandez shows how roofs can be divided into six main categories with shape usually determined by the building’s purpose, as well as the rank and role of the people housed there. Symbolism is given great importance throughout Chinese culture. Mythical creatures such as phoenixes and dragons are related to power, prosperity or royalty and are used to dd prestige to the Forbidden City. The Hall of Supreme Harmony, for example, boasts 13,433 individual dragons ornaments. These sculpted figures were distinctively coloured by glazes employing a chemical process to make the sculptures more durable.

The most significant consequence is a distorted perception of reality, as the public opinion is built upon information and assumptions gathered from channels of misinformation and fake news, invoking an increase in stereotyping and prejudice in public thought and everyday discourse, in particular against foreigners. The resulting opinions are hard to debunk as their longevity is rooted in years of misperception, but is there any truth to this xenophobic anti-immigrant rhetoric? Do immigrants really steal our jobs? Are we experiencing an ""invasion"" or maybe even an Islamization? El Dorado provides more transparent information about the Italians and migrants phenomenon, through tangible data-telling objects in the public space, in particular about the situation in Italy on a more general level. The intention is to show through tangible means exhibited in public space, a different view on this phenomenon and to provide a straightforward means to see the reality behind the figures and public perception: the audience has the possibility to understand at a glance by interacting with ""capsules"" of information. The data concerning the foreigners is golden, and the question I want to raise is whether the foreigners are an opportunity for the arrival country or not. Who profits? Them or us?"

How do we embrace the uncertainty surrounding these new mobility technologies? Cities have been losing the fight with the automotive industry. The failure to act proactively in the field of shared and autonomous mobility would risk urban futures similar to the car-centric developments that prevailed in the 20th century. If left unchecked, the widespread adoption of shared and autonomous mobility could exacerbate city sprawl, increase congestion and pollution, discourage active travel and human-centred spaces and decrease equal access to jobs. If shaped proactively, with clear terms of reference designed to optimise positive societal outcomes, widespread adoption could decrease congestion and pollution, free space for enhanced public spaces, solve the transportation last mile problem and increase equal access to jobs. This visualisation looks at some of the key factors that impact traffic patterns and explores the complex relationships between them. By building on extensive research and data, including typical demand conditions in various cities, local propensities to use shared services, the costs of driving a car as well as socio-economic and cultural variables, it shows the magnitude of impact that shared and autonomous mobility technologies will have on urban congestion. In thinking through the potential implications of multiple future changes in a clear way, we can help city decision makers manage risk in the face of uncertainty, while also adding a measure of flexibility to policy decisions. With appropriate market shaping, autonomous vehicles and mobility services could help cure congestion in cities. This visualisation will give decision makers a better understanding of how changes in different parameters within their control are likely to impact actual behaviour; hence it will help them to identify the most critical areas for new regulations and policies when trying to solve congestion problems.

Malleshwaram mesmerizes, the heart of it—a potpourri of1 flavours, colours, sights, smells unfolding in the streets; the play of light amidst the green of trees, coffee, food and sounds ringing from its busy bazaars, a warm community with beautiful homes, wooden doors, temples and flowers decorating its nooks—is many complex layers. Tranquil and busy, silent and colourful chaos all at once. Sauntering along its mains and crosses, one soaks in this ‘image of the city’ as Lynch would call it. How may we paint this ‘image’ on the geographic canvas? How may we represent the complex ‘sense of place’ we experience by the virtue of being in it? Malleshwaram memoirs is an attempt at mapping places to make visible the sense of ‘lived place’ we experience by being in places. It is an experiment to invite and entice the reader to walk about the streets of Malleshwaram. The work builds on the notion of rhythms in urban places and translates them visually through a rhythmic framework. The data represented has been manually collected and builds on previous body of work. The work metaphorically presents the city place as a musical ensemble, a symphony uniquely shaped by its sense of dwelling. The technique (a work in progress) is promising in offering a visual framework to develop new modes of notation for representing complex urban phenomenon that may in turn be instrumental in informing urban planning decisions to nurture places and not just spaces. It explores the boundaries of map as an instrument for way finding as we commonly use it and instead as a vehicle for reordering the way we perceive a place.

Blossom	Today in the world there are 541 million young workers, accounting for over 15 per cent of the global labour force. What does it mean to be young workers in 2018? With 313 million workers suffering from non-fatal work-related injury and illness every year, young people are up to 40 per cent more likely to suffer a work-related injury than older workers. Many feel pressure to accept the first job offer they get, often without considering if the working conditions put their health and safety at risk. This is a problem, since young workers suffer from injury and illness on the job at far higher rates than their adult counterparts. Poor occupational safety and health practices cost an estimated 4 per cent of global Gross Domestic Product each year, almost 3 trillion in US Dollars. A young person who is gravely injured at work potentially represents years of lost productivity. Blossom was contacted to tell this story digitally, on the International Labour Organization (ILO)’s infostories website. The InfoStories website offers interactive narratives based on research findings from the International Labour Organization. Each issue presents a unique perspective on a labour-related theme, told through a narrative enriched with interactive data visualizations, videos, maps and case studies. The challenge for Blossom was to find a new way to disclose this situation, making it interesting, clear, engaging and universal. We have chosen an editorial approach, where illustrations are more able to bring stories to life and entice readers to engage with content. The data and information are broken down in “sub-chapters” and illustrated, depicting common situations happening daily to young workers in the labour market all over the world. Each illustration is animated, to make the depicted situations more realistic and “alive”. Data and information are accessible by clicking to buttons, taking the user to new tabs with numbers and percentages, to case-studies and stories or to multimedia materials. The experience we propose is an information travel, a new digital narrative in the daily life of young workers, to make the user aware of the too many risks they face.

521	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3909-visualizing-shark-numbers	Visualizing Shark Numbers	Julia Janicki	Visualizing Shark Numbers is an interactive story that incorporates data visualizations and scientific illustrations with the purpose of highlighting the diversity of sharks and shedding light on their plight. The visualization part was built in Javascript, including libraries such as D3 and ScrollMagic. Sharks are incredibly diverse, with over 510 species in 34 families, with great variation in size, behavior, appearance, life expectancy, and food preference. For example, the longest-lived shark (The Greenland Shark) was recorded at 512 years old! Moreover, not all sharks are predators as often portrayed by the media, Whale sharks and Basking sharks are filter feeders, for example. Unfortunately, roughly 100 million sharks are caught and killed by humans every year, mostly as a result of bycatch and shark finning. All 14 shark species most prevalent in the shark fin trade are threatened or near threatened with extinction. Even though 15-16% of shark species are threatened with extinction, with another 45% listed as data deficient or not evaluated, only 22 species are protected by CITES, a treaty that regulates the trade of different species. More awareness and attention need to be given to this group of animals in order for them to survive. In this visualization, the reader will learn about various shark species, their plight, and about how we can fight to ensure their survival.

I divide my life into four main parts, education, family’s activities, friend’s activities and solitude. Meanwhile, there are four colors to represent them, blue stands for education, green means family’s activities, purple indicates friend’s activities, and orange represents solitude. So readers will be able to see how much each item roughly accounts for my life at once, at one glance. Furthermore, each circle represents one year since 1991 when I born to 2017. Dotted lines are shown every five years to identify the map more clearly. As you can see, there are many dots with different colors. These dots are used to show the frequency of family’s activities, friend’s activities and solitude occurring at different times. For instance, the family’s activities mostly gathered when I was young and then decrease as I grew older. On the contrary, the frequency of friend’s activities increase. Also, I represent my educational stages in five different colors, Elementary school, middle school, high school, undergrad school and Grad school.

For the first time since the 1950s, a party to the right of the CDU/CSU is on track to enter the German parliament: the right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany, AfD). Using this application, the Berliner Morgenpost has investigated which parts of Germany have voted for the far-right since reunification, and subjects widely held beliefs regarding the far-right parties and their voters to a fact check. An interactive map provides a detailed overview of the voting results recorded in the polling stations for the extreme right-wing (brown) and right-wing populist (blue) parties for the around 11,000 municipalities in Germany. The results for all German federal elections stretching back to 1990 can be viewed by election year. The map is supplemented with a graphic showing the most recent polling results, and the accompanying text describes and expounds on the various views the interactive map allows. A brief video report provides some insight into the far-right heartlands, while widely held beliefs such as “the far-right does best where few foreigners live” and “far-right parties do better in rural areas than in major cities” are examined using statistical data in the analysis mode of the application.

545	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2465-drawing-feelings	Drawing Feelings	Ondina Frate, NYU	"  ""Drawing Feelings"" is a personal journey of finding my inside and outside worlds through daily drawings of objects that represent my feelings. World Inside represents how we feel in society and World Inside represents how we really feel and what we hide from the world. Objects that influenced my day are drawn on paper every night for 30 days, then traced in Illustrator, and animated on the web in a way that conveys a story. The story begins on Feb 19th and ends on March 20th 2017. I split the paper in two: the world inside and the world outside. The world inside represents how we feel and act based on what the society's norms are and the inside world represents how we really feel and what we hide from the world. My goal was not just to draw these objects, but also to track and capture my feelings through these drawings. My idea was to explore the power of drawing on paper and share it through the web to be more accessible. Each day I drew my feelings by giving them visual substance. The size of each object represents, on a scale from 1-6, the intensity of that feeling. While this project is a very personal one, I realized that it could become universal. I invited people to draw their feelings as objects as a way to see how other people see their worlds. I was so surprised to see that so many people shared their inside and outside worlds with me with so much transparency. They drew their feelings as objects on the spot, which felt so incredible to me. People that never drew before wanted to give it a try as well as people that were already good at drawing. Their drawings convey their own story about their feelings. Any data visualization represents a relationship between the viewer and the information we convey. Since Drawing Feelings uses my personal data, I realized that it reveals a lot about who I am. ART MANIFESTO 1. When I was little I used to draw and paint a lot. Remember what you liked when you were a child and do that again. Maybe that’s the secret of becoming confident about your work. 2. There are always two worlds inside us: what we show to the world and what we don’t show. Make your worlds meet in the middle. 3. Define what’s most important for you in life and eliminate everything else. Beyond this data visualization, Drawing Feelings represents a connection between my feelings and the audience. It represents an art manifesto of being who you are and sharing that to the world. It represents a bold statement to trust your feelings when in doubt and question your feelings when confident."

There are 20 trees, one for each of the 20 largest UK funders. The features of each tree, such as the lengths of its branches and its height, reflect key characteristics of the funder, including the value of grants they have awarded and the themes that they have funded. Together the trees show who has funded which themes throughout the years. The trees are an example of a physical data visualisation, where data values are encoded in the attributes of an object.

The original data include ~170 Million trips. Of these, 30 cab/days were queried at random for inclusion in this project. The data were provided by the Taxi and Limousine Commission via a FOIL request.  The intent is to analyze running counts of fares, taxes, etc, over the course of a day, and to see how/when taxis move around New York.  The raw data include only start and end locations for each trip. These points were run through Google's Directions API to create the routes shown in this visualization.

The research showed that the possibilities for future use of augmented reality and virtual reality are literally endless, and it has the potential to be utilized in many different industries across the globe. In addition, the research showed that consumers enjoy increased information and interactivity whilst using augmented reality and virtual reality. The research findings then lead me to design, develop, and create an augmented reality enabled poster concept aimed at young children, to be used in a school setting, to teach and also entertain. I chose the subject of space for the infographic, as it is in the UK National Curriculum for children of a young age, thus rendering the infographic useful. Included are countless large and small written and visual details, in order to emphasize the sheer endless scale of space itself. The infographic not only teaches, entertains, and excites young minds, but also encourages children to think deeper about space and the universe, and learn more about it.

While there was once big ""predatory"" fish and small ""prey"" fish in healthy proportions, overfishing has decimated our ocean's big fish (i.e. the ones humans catch and eat) and left small fish populations overly abundant. The decline was modest until 1970, and then took a sharp and drastic turn for the worst.

It was founded in 1919 by German architect Walter Gropius. The establishment of Bauhaus marks the birth of modern design education. The school combines art and technology to cultivate a large number of designers with international influence. After the school was closed in 1933, these famous teachers and excellent students were distributed in different countries, and passed on the Bauhaus concept to the whole world, which had a profound influence on the development of modern design in the world. Starting from the inheritance of Bauhaus concept, the graduation design shows the development process of Bauhaus, the information of workshops and projects, the works of students, the process and works of three principals, the systematic information design of teacher information and student information through the forms of sequential charts and systematic organization charts.

The city's regulation requires people to sort trash into four categories - dry garbage, wet garbage (kitchen waste), recyclables and hazardous waste.  Although some resources have already listed out things belong to four categories, it is still hard for residents to get the gist of the waste sorting. Therefore, instead of text, we decided to visualize it.  Under the new rule, different parts of one thing or different usages of one thing could lead to different waste sorting. For instance, glass bottles of milk are recyclable waste, while the same containers of medicine are hazardous. To make things clear, we applied five colors to four categories of waste mentioned above and non-domestic wastes. Then, we colored 2055 things and grouped them into 47 queries.  Each ball of the visualization represents one query group of items, like packing materials, cups, pens, metals, and more. The colors of the ball are a mixture of the colors of every single item of the query group. The higher prevalence of one color, the more likely the query group belongs to a waste category. For example, the ball of electronics is almost covered by blue, so we learned that most electronics are recyclable. Seeing the visualization, readers can instantly get the whole picture of waste sorting. If they are especially interested in one query group, they can click on the ball and check the attribute of every item.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Longlist;Science & Technology

Nodes are connected based on whether they are friends on Facebook. A force directed algorithm then simulates physics based attraction and repulsion of the nodes, i.e. the nodes who are friends attract and the ones that aren't friends repel - splitting the whole network into clusters that represent the different contexts of my life - such as 'School', 'College', 'Family', 'Work' automatically without any explicit information about the people. This project demonstrates how powerful network analysis can be to see how our network is shaped and how closely knit they are.

This visualization is constructed as a line-by-line annotation of each sound that recurs at least four times following its initial introduction.

643	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3757-how-life-has-changed-for-people-your-age	How Life Has Changed For People Your Age	ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)	In Australia, the debate about the generational divide is as heated as it ever was, stoked by stereotypical media-baiting — from the Baby Boomers who wrecked the world and stole all the wealth, to Millennials with their sense of entitlement and lack of work ethic. The truth about whether life is better or worse now than it was 30 years ago lies somewhere in the middle. With that emotional environment in mind, the ABC News Story Lab wanted to find a way of introducing hard data into the debate to actually show ‘How Life Has Changed' for people of various ages since the 1980s. We combed publicly available data for the outcomes that make a difference to people’s lives - home ownership rates, life expectancy, death rates from common diseases, education levels and employment rates, to name a few. The aim was to show readers how life in the 1980s was different for people of their own age. We therefore structured the interactive story by 10-year age categories, grouping outcomes most relevant to that age group. Readers could either click on an age category they were interested in, or scroll through the whole story to each about each group. The data was presented in slope charts with start and end points of (approximately) 1981 and 2016, showing male and female data where relevant. Slope charts are a simple, uncluttered way to show the change between two time points where the activity in between is not important. The slope of the chart reflected the percent change from the 1980s and the lines were scaled to reflect the most striking differences - a steeper line indicated a more dramatic change. The data was supplemented with commentary from newspaper articles of the time to show how attitudes had changed. For example, the headline for a chart on how childhood obesity has increased by 145% was ‘Australia was still becoming accustomed to working mothers in 1981. “Children grow fat while mothers work,” one headline screamed.’ This piece made the shortlist for Data Visualisation of the Year at the Data Journalism Awards 2019.

In the spring of 2013, one rumour really got fans' hopes up by suggesting a major proportion of the 106 missing episodes had been found and were about to be returned to the BBC. As ever, no proof was provided by the many people claiming to have heard of the discovery from unnamed sources, but fans seemed largely taken in by the audacity of suggesting such a large recovery of material. An unidentified African country (or countries) was soon being discussed as the site of the discovery, and indeed the BBC had sold the series to several TV stations across the continent in the 1960s and early 70s. Such film copies licensed to overseas broadcasters are the only chance for these episodes' survival and account for most of the recoveries made in the last 30 years. But fans began speculating about possible countries irrespective of whether they had actually bought the programme, and naming supposedly recovered episodes even though they had never been shown in Africa. To try to clarify the possibilities, I produced this infographic showing which African countries licensed which 1960s episodes of Doctor Who, when they broadcast them and where the film prints the BBC sent them might be now. Much research has been done into the sale of Doctor Who overseas and subsequent attempts to recover those film prints based on primary evidence from (incomplete) BBC records â€” most notably by Richard Molesworth in his book “Wiped!” (Telos Publishing, 2010) â€” while the website broadwcast.org catalogues when episodes were actually broadcast around the world based on evidence from local newspaper TV listings. These were my two sources for the graphic. As I was dealing with partly geographic information, a map was the obvious form to use. I also visualised the Doctor Who episodes under consideration with an icon based on a design element unique to each one. These were grouped into the batches that each country had licensed at various times, which revealed how often the same groups of episodes had been redistributed around the continent. There are few records of what happened to film prints after a particular broadcaster had shown them (they were supposed to return them to the BBC, destroy them or send them to another country that had since arranged to show the programme) but using the dates of transmission, where known, it was possible to suggest the likely route the episodes had taken to identify which countries they might have ended up in (whether subsequently destroyed or not). The infographic was posted on several Doctor Who discussion forums where it helped negate some of the wilder speculation and highlight which stories were unlikely to be recovered. Although fans never give up hope, this rumour of a sizeable recovery is now considered to be sadly untrue.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Infographic

With three in four Brits saying it’s important to support shops on their local high street, but a worrying economic climate leading to national brands favouring an online presence, we wanted to discover what the UK high street actually looks like in 2019 and how that differs by location. To find out, we analysed a sample of 6,682 businesses across 120 high streets from towns in all 12 regions of England, as well as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. We categorised businesses and shops by their function (for example, food and drink, retail or recreational) to understand just how our high streets are made up. We used the data to show what type of businesses make up the average UK high street and also split out the results by region (vital for regional press coverage). We ranked the best areas for positive businesses such as Cafes and Retail, and the worst areas for what can be viewed as negative factors – pawn brokers, fast food and gambling shops. Finally, by noting which businesses on high streets are either independently owned or part of a chain, we were able to show which regions in the UK had the most and least independent businesses. https://togethermoney.com/high-street-split/	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Maps, Places & Spaces;Longlist

Andrew Levinson	Cookies are one of the most misunderstood pieces of the modern web. While technically a cookie is just a simple text (.txt) file stored on your computer when you visit websites, its purposes are often confusing. The technology that enables basic online shopping is the same technology that allows third parties to track your movement across all your online activities. That raw power makes this worthy of a deeper dive. To illustrate this, I did my own experiment. Starting with a clean slate, I cleared my browsing history, cache, and cookies. I then browsed the US internet's most popular websites for one uninterrupted hour. At the end of the hour, I exported the 1,117 new cookies that were placed on my computer during that time, with the help of a Firefox plugin, and analyzed the results.

They are characterised by a very small wave length and permeate almost all materials on earth. We cannot see them and generally only notice them when they are linked to radioactivity; when we deal with the consequences of atomic bombs and nuclear power plants.

All guests wore a personal bracelet designed by BYBORRE, equipped with technology from the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica. Through these hybrid bracelets, we collected activity-, movement- and temperature data. With this data we created personalized, real-time data visualizations, which were projected as visuals during the club event. Afterwards, all guests received their “Flight of the Night”: a unique, personalised souvenir, summarizing their data visualization of the night. Each visualization consisted of a colored spiral: the colors indicated how much time the guest had spent in every room, the thickness of the line indicated the activity of the guest in every room. The more movement, the thicker the line. The personal visualizations also included the musical highlight of the guest, complete with the time and room in which the song was played.

700	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2743-regional-population-structures-at-a-glance	Regional Population Structures At A Glance	Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute	Population ageing is a major demographic challenge for humanity. Since population structures evolve slowly and predictably, the demographic, economic, environmental, and social problems of ageing have been anticipated and discussed for many decades. Yet the focus of these discussions has always been the elderly population, with elderly people often defined as those older than a threshold—eg, 65 years or age at retirement—or with a certain number of estimated remaining years of life. Such a focus is quite reasonable and understandable but not entirely correct. Ageing is not exclusively about the size of the elderly population or its proportion of a population; ageing is a function of the entire age distribution of a population. Therefore, to better understand ageing, we need to focus on the evolution of the age structure of the entire population, not just the elderly part. We offer a new approach to investigate the diversity of population ageing in Europe. To map the whole population age structures rather than any single summary measure of ageing, we used ternary colour coding—a technique that maximises the amount of information conveyed by colours. With this approach, each element of a three-dimensional array of compositional data is represented with a unique colour.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Maps, Places & Spaces;Longlist

710	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3814-violence-global-living-conditions-a-public-trend-visualization	Violence & Global Living Conditions – A Public Trend Visualization	MIrko Clemente	The exhibition “Gender and Violence” at the Museum of Military History in Dresden addressed acts of violence and the place of gender roles and gender prejudices within this theme. With this, it shook up various stereotypes, and challenged the common image of the violent man versus the peaceable woman.  For the museum, I have collaborated with the agency kursiv to approach the topic from a statistical perspective. We have created a presentation which offers visualizations of trends in both violence and global living conditions. Included are statistics on military and civilian violence, population, literacy, poverty, and democratization. The effects of some conditions that may cause violence are still a matter of much dispute. Therefore, the project encourages conversation about our progress towards a less violent future.  The presentation is projected onto a large canvas. The diagrams make use of animations to expose underlying trends in successive years. In addition, bold labels show data values for the current year. Both the animations and the labels focus the visitor’s attention and guide them through the data, which we obtained from the “Our World in Data” project by Max Roser.  https://vimeo.com/358936744 The entrant has supplied multiple files for this project: [1] [2]	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Longlist;People, Language & Identity

718	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/370-oakland-crime-and-citizen-data	Oakland Crime and Citizen Data	Natesh Daniel	During the early part of 2012, the City of Oakland's mayor Jean Quan was claiming that 90 percent of the city's homicides and shootings occurred in 100 of the city's 6,560 blocks, and that a plan to direct police resources to these areas would essentially reduce violence citywide. Adding to the public's skepticism of this claim was the Mayor's refusal to name the 100 blocks or disclose the data on which she based the plan. Citizen reporter CB Smith-Dahl, of the local news blog Oakland Local, disputed this idea and hired me to help her engage in data journalism. With the help of a web-based public data tool called Oakland Crimespotting, we were able to download nearly 40,000 crime records collected from CrimeWatch and determine if 90 percent of the homicides could be reduced to 100 blocks. The data proved unwieldy and hard to sift through. It became obvious that the Mayor's claim was wrong but we couldn't provide a timely response. We took a two-step process to first identify where crime occurred, by police beat, and produced this map. A year-over-year comparison included on the map also indicated that crime rates were declining. Soon after we published this map on the Oakland Local blog, the nonprofit Urban Strategies Council issued a report challenging the 100-block plan data, saying that the city's most dangerous 100 blocks over the past five years accounted for only 17 percent of the city's crime, not 90 percent. They beat us to the second step.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Data journalism

729	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3078-parliament-360	Parliament 360	CNN	CNN’s Houses of Parliament interactive offers audiences a unique experience: the chance to step inside one of the world’s most iconic buildings in a purpose-built 360 immersive environment. Users get to stand under Big Ben as it tolls the hour, see the Robing Room where the Queen puts on her crown and gown before addressing joint sessions of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and stand at the dispatch box where Theresa May faces her weekly grilling by lawmakers during Prime Minister’s Questions. And those are just some of more than a dozen locations in the virtual reality interactive. CNN was also allowed to place 360 cameras in areas never open to the public. Viewers can step into the climate-controlled Act Room, where 64,000 British laws are stored on parchment scrolls dating back 500 years; onto the roof to see views of the London Eye, Shard and Westminster Abbey; and into the basement, where miles of cables and pipes snake overhead with no known rhyme or reason. The interactive offers much more than just a chance to look around: narration by CNN anchor Max Foster gives users the history and key facts about the building known as “the Mother of Parliaments,” while CNN digs pulls from archives so audiences can hear Queen Elizabeth deliver a speech and Tony Blair duel with David Cameron in the Commons. And audiences can dig even deeper by clicking on the dozens of hotpoints scattered through the interactive, learning everything from the history of the Gunpowder Plot and the word “lobbying” to the myths and superstitions that haunt Parliament. This purpose-built interactive is the product of more than a year of work that began when CNN spotted a rare opportunity to film throughout the Parliamentary estate. The complex is over 150 years old and is in dire need of major repairs. Lawmakers’ plans to renovate the building provided the news peg to open months of negotiations with the gatekeepers of the complex, ultimately resulting in unprecedented access to the site. A team of editors, designers and developers led by Senior News Editor Richard Allen Greene and Lead Designer Sarah-Grace Mankarious spent nine months building the interactive, timed to release when Queen Elizabeth II delivered the Queen’s Speech to open the Parliamentary legislative session in June 2017. With mobile-first design, the interactive launched with support from all CNN platforms, including a push across social media and a TV spot promoting the Digital product.

737	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/29-interactive-optimisation-time-saving-tool	Interactive Optimisation Time Saving Tool	David Murphy	This interactive tool was created to help people work out how much time they could save if they found quicker ways of doing things in their life. I used Tableau Public in a way that it isn't usually used, in order to create this interactive infographic. In work and personal life, many people slog away in time consuming tasks, never taking the time to step back and see if it can be done faster/better – reciting the mantra “but it only takes 5 minutes, why bother?”. This irks me, as those 5 minutes can add up to substantial losses of one's time, which could be better spent doing other things. Getting people to see this is tricky, so I built the tool to help people realise the wider impact these collective tiny task can create. An interactive infographic only succeeds if it is used. Anything too complex and it will confuse and put off users from interacting with it. In order to increase its use, the effort by the user is streamlined, so they only have to enter in four inputs. They can then instantly see how much time they or their team could save in a neat and well-structured infographic (less is more for this use). I also wanted to liberate the tool and make it more accessible, hence it's size dimensions. Harnessing Tableau Public's browser functionality, users can interactive with and create their own personalised infographic wherever they are on any device i.e. it works on smartphones, tablets and PCs. They can then take screenshots or use Tableau Public's inbuilt pdf/jpeg export functionality to save these personalised infographics. I have successfully used this tool to win investment on spending the time automating reporting processes at my company – the infographic showed that a team of 4 could (and has) saved just over 200 working days a year due to this investment. Nearly a whole headcount!  Other users have reported similar success, when being presented with invest case support, or to push back on new processes by looking at the macro impact to them, their team or the company.

I collected my data by hand and later transferred it onto a spreadsheet. The overwhelming detail of my data led me to group my data into four categories: ‘sit', ‘sleep', ‘stand’ and ‘move.’ I then decided to display the minute breakdown of my activities through the use of shape and color. Each small circle on the poster represents a minute of time (accumulating to 1440 in total!) The small circle is colored by the activity it consumed. Each block is grouped in 30-minute intervals of my day. I created this piece by collecting my data by hand, coding the grid in Nodebox, and completing the design work on illustrator. I was inspired by the quote 'Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.' from Ferris Bueller's Day Off (one of my favorite films!)

756	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2214-explaining-training-shot-quality-for-soccer	Explaining & Training Shot Quality for Soccer	Charlotte Randall	The use of Analytics in the Football industry (European Football, or Soccer) is in its infancy. Unlike the US, where analytics are integral to any sports organisation, in Europe, it's just getting started. Whilst most football clubs will have an Analytics team, the focus tends to be on traditional methods of performance analysis and scouting. Our company, StatsBomb Services, launched in January this year with the aim of providing football clubs with analytics tools that are simple to use and help integrate what can be an intimidating field of expertise easily into club culture. Opta are the principal data supplier, we parse 400,000 events every week. Analysing this data and finding ways to create simple data visualisations that add value that the industry will accept and learn from is our primary focus. One critical concept that we aim to educate our clients about is Shot Quality. Taking higher value shots makes your attack and scoring output more consistent. As a result, it should make you more likely to win. This is one of the easiest concepts to grasp from an analytical perspective and one of the hardest to teach to football people. It flows from four basic principles: - The closer a shot is to goal, the more likely it is to be converted. - Central locations are better than wide. (This mostly has to do with angles of the goal covered by the goalkeeper from wide shots.) - At the same distance, shots with feet are far more likely to become goals than shots with the head. - Crosses are hard. When it comes to shots, you are dealing with hundreds of thousands of past attempts where a player has taken a shot. If they have never been taught where to take them, a player then needs to actively think before they might shoot whether that shot is good or not, and then choose whether to take it. The combination of a fan culture where long-range goals make the highlight shows and get the plaudits from the pundits, and the sheer weight of habit make this a hard concept to convey, especially to mature professional footballers. This is even more true if no one has explained the concept of good and bad shots to players previously. And so we have generated our shot map. There are others around, but ours is interactive, users can select types of shots they are interested in, and can easily see which shots convert to goals, from where. These are visualised at a player or team level. We hope to have simplified this sometimes mystifying concept for our audience, whilst retaining the complexity and integrity of the data.

One's physical location is just a single variable in the multitude of virtual projections possible in the networked world. Country borders may be highly controlled, but thoughts and ideas follow more fluid paths. The UnFacebook World Map is a remix of two popular images: NASA's Earth at Night, and Facebook's Friendship Map. By subtracting the Facebook map from the NASA one, we end up with a new kind of tension between two zones: the ancient technologies of situated human settlement (rendered visible by electric light) and the newer technologies of disembodied electronic communication.

In fact, since executions resumed that year following a four-year suspension imposed by the Supreme Court, we know many specifics including race, age, sex and other information about those who have paid the ultimate price in the criminal justice system.

All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its color are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.” ― Arthur Conan Doyle In The Naval Treaty, Arthur Conan Doyle eloquently compared abundant life to flowers. However, his words also speak of those things ""necessary for existence"" before the abundance and beauty of life can be exposed. Today, many countries still lack many of these things that are necessary for existence. There are some countries where only 6 out of every 100 people have access to clean drinking water. In other countries, nearly 40% of people are undernourished. Due to the efforts of charities, governments, and caring individuals, this problem is improving and many countries are beginning to blossom.

But each country has different challenges according to their level of development, demographics, risk factors and lifestyle patterns. The Cancer Atlas brings together cancer control experts from around the world to present useful and comprehensible information to aid in the fight against cancer. The 136-page book is comprised of nearly 100 insets and 44 choropleth-coded maps illustrating global data. The visual voice was inspired by academic quarterly publications; sophisticated but digestible, with a color palette inspired by tissue and cell photography. Circles are used as a consistent throughline, to represent the cellular and global levels that cancer strikes. The cover design sets up the vast scale of the issues, balancing a single cancer cell atop the globe. The stark blackness of the cover is repeated in section dividers that also use photographs as chart-like elements. Visual hierarchy of each page allows skimming and browsing, while details invite careful reading. The left column is used as a brief summary of the chapter; numbered indicators in the body copy point readers to the insets for the deeper story. This Atlas was designed with its wide-reaching audience in mind. It needed to be accessible to audiences from policy makes to patients; it needed to be portable as chapters and as discreet graphics. Single spreads can serve as infographic topic-driven posters; individual graphic insets can be parsed out as digital assets into presentations and social media. A consistent visual system and underlying grid provides structure for the varied print content and help it translate to the companion website (canceratlas.cancer.org) and social media. “We at the Society believe this critical publication will be an essential and accessible resource for everyone involved in the cancer fight—from advocates and agencies to policymakers and patients, and everyone in between… Information is a powerful tool in the hands of passionate, dedicated individuals, and this book provides an unparalleled resource to arm and inform everyone committed to this fight.” —John Seffrin, Chief Executive Officer, American Cancer Society	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2015	Longlist;Dataviz Project

817	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2436-inequalities-quipu	Inequalities Quipu	Ewa Tuteja	This project is about the revival of the ancient Incan Quipu. Quipu is a recording device used by the Incas for collecting and keeping track of data. It consists of cords containing numeric and other values encoded by knots in a base ten positional system.  I found myself in immediate amazement. Such a beautiful and little abstract way of displaying information. Holding information from past times. Enduring time. I decided to revive the quipu. To combine ancient and modern. Modern questions about life with old ways of recording life. This physical visualisation (physicalisation) shows the comparison of well-being in Latin America (where settlements of the Incan empire were situated) and top leading countries in Scandinavia as assessed by the OECD Better Life Index. It visualises the inequalities between those two cultures as well as between men and women. The basic materials for a quipu are coloured cords. I prepared all the cords myself, which means twisting crochet yarn to create thicker cords. The two resulting quipus are made of over 180 hand twisted individual cords. The individual values, that are behind the calculated index are encoded at the top of the cords with knots. Additionally, I introduced another property, which seems to have been irrelevant for the original quipus, but which is for us nowadays a common way to read data: I introduced the length of the cords as a dimension for the value of the index scores. The longer the cord, the higher the score.  The nature of an abstract visualization is that an accurate deduction of the data is rather difficult. It is rather intended to get an impression of the nature of the differences. This project is about an ancient method reborn into the new world. It’s about encoding digital data into analogue means. Going from fast to slow. I like the fact that this can possibly endure time and potentially can be found in hundred of years and tell a story of this special moment in time.

More than 1.3 million people used the tool during the election campaign, providing us with a wealth of data about what Australians thought about a range of key political issues. We wanted to help people understand that data - and see how different groups of Australians responded to the issues. We built a quiz interface that asked millennials to place where they thought baby boomers stood on the issues, and vice versa. We used conversational speech and emoticons to try to lower the barriers to important election coverage and to engage an audience who was struggling with election fatigue. The interaction model forced people to think deeply about the issues and consider how other people may think politically, along the way informing them about the political process and the views of their fellow voters during a key election cycle.

How many walks were there? How long were they out there? How far did they explore? What exactly did they do? The interactive story conveys the scale – in both space and time – of the first moon landing. Scroll through highlights from the radio transcript like a messaging app. A perspective map changes in step to show the action. The story begins at the moment the Lunar Module hatch opens and ends when the hatch closes. Color distinguishes Neil and Buzz’s action and dialog. Hand drawn illustrations help humanize the adventure. Too many looks at the history of space exploration are too cold—too machine. The story creates a relatable context for the Apollo 11 moonwalk by uniting a wealth of data resources in a way never before achieved. By story end, I hope the humanity of the Apollo 11 accomplishment resonates with the viewer. Only a small portion of the moonwalk’s transcript is featured. My goal was to give a sense of the moonwalk that was accessible to many. I did not want to create a feature-length film or exhaustive interactive dashboard. Only the spiciest parts of the transcript stayed. The piece is a data story. It is edited for maximum effect. The story is built on research that triangulates original Apollo documents. These include official maps, transcripts, photos, video, and reports. I constructed my spatial-temporal understanding of the moonwalk by buildling many planning documents. The Hasselblad photos are the data linchpin to this story. NASA has published where and when each photograph was taken. These snapshots can be matched to the transcript timeline and USGS maps. Creating a custom interactive opened doors to a lot of fun. NASA media was included via new GIFs made just for this piece. If you missed them on first read, go back to the story and hover or touch the images embedded within the conversation. The timeline below the moonscape shows a circle for each radio transmission. The circles are sized by transmission length (number of characters). Transmissions highlighted in the story are colored by speaker. Transmissions not shown in the story remains grey. At the very end of the story all the color rushes for the entire script. This gives a rough feel for how much everyone spoke. The story ends with a short outro. This lets me share something learned during my research that I never knew. Neil and Buzz had a slumber party on the Moon!

Data Memento	FH Hannover	"Christopher Nolan`s Thriller Memento deals with a man who suffers from a short-term memory loss, an alleged murder and the nature of the crime. Furthermore the component of vengeance is addressed. The film's appeal is not about the plot itself but rather about the intelligent narrative structure. This unusual rhetorical device embodies the fundamental element of the interactive data visualization of „10 Minute Man“. The user takes on the director’s role and creates bizarre narratives. A person – acts – at a place – at a certain time. These four parameters build the core, from which obscure ""data formations"" originate in a 3D diagram. The script of the movie serves as a starting point – 9.935 words in 113 minutes. To localize the language in space and time, word frequency, point in time, and the position of a person in the moment of speaking are used as variables in the visualization. As a result, the user is invited to explore his stories from inside the room. Altogether, it represents an artistic product where narrative, archival and aesthetic elements merge together."

It may seem an abstract question but abstract financial ideas cratered the world economy. We need inclusive data visualisations to make comprehensive assessments on the health of institutions and entire economies? So, where to start? Debt. Take the credit ratings of European economies. Discrete, or classified data - from AAA to CCC. Then take those same economies debt-to-GDP ratios, and the quantities of that debt. Putting that information together gives you a scatter plot, and one where debt and credit ratings do not tell the full story. The size and the severity of a nation's debt and credit worthiness are not always the same thing: individual data points are categorised by shape to distinguish a €500m debt economy to a nation with billions of debt in issue. Then consider the banks that are based in those economies - after all that is what contagion is - when the performance of a nation's debt affects the constituent financial institutions in that nation and vice versa. So, we took the official bank stress test results and sorted by the banks' own debt holdings. This is not data that would fit in a scatter plot, which explains the halo around the core data sets. The connecting lines maps which banks belong to which economies. Those economies with the most connecting banks in the most precarious zone of the scatter plot with a shape representing significant debt in issue (such as Italy) represent a dangerous combination and a higher propensity for financial market contagion. Especially in times of heightened market fear. With thanks to Alessio Macri, original creator of the static graphic. Video created in Premiere, After Effects and Cinema 4D.

892	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3924-counting-the-cost-of-the-education-revolution	Counting The Cost Of The Education Revolution	ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)	In 2008, the Australian government announced an “education revolution” -- a fundamental overhaul of a school funding system that had been in place in essence since 1974. Billions were poured into the school system to achieve one key goal: improve student performance through more equitable funding. Our investigation revealed that rather than closing the equity gap, the income divide for many schools has grown wider than at any point since the “revolution”. The first challenge of this story was collecting the data; the second was finding the most rigorous way to use it; the third was transforming it into a compelling visual story. PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN DATA • At the core of this investigation is My School data – one of Australia’s most tightly-held datasets on school resourcing • Numerous media outlets have attempted to scrape the data. ABC News is the first to successfully scrape the full dataset • To verify the data, we worked closely with academic researchers who were familiar the dataset. GROUND-BREAKING ANALYSIS • ABC News’ analysis of school resourcing is the most comprehensive and detailed to date, comparing the individual finances of nearly every school in Australia over eight years • The painstaking, five-month analysis is the first of its kind. Four independent education researchers validated our methodology and results • Due to a lack of data, previous analyses have relied on aggregates and averages, which mask significant differences between individual schools • Our methodology “compared apples with apples” by generating a unique set of similar schools for every school in Australia. This allowed us to show for the first time the worsening public/private divide between “like” schools. CREATIVE VISUAL STORYTELLING • Our visual language aimed to emphasise individual schools, as this was a key point of difference in our analysis • We used line charts, bar charts and dot plots to orient the audience within the “big picture”, and beeswarms and scatterplots to demonstrate the stark differences between the individual schools that make up this picture • The technical challenge of visualising 8,400 dots – particularly for our large mobile phone readership -- required creative solutions. • With the beeswarm/scatterplot “scrollyteller” animation, dor example, there was too much data to calculate the layout in the browser, so we pre-calculated and stored the point locations for each step of the animation. This allowed us to present large amounts of data while avoiding long load times and high browser stress. UNPRECEDENTED DATABASE • Lastly, we built an interactive database to show readers “personalised” data for their school, and present our data transparently • This database allowed users to compare the public and private funding gap between any given school and its unique set of similar schools across the country.

893	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2456-the-new-top-10-furnace-cities-in-china	The New Top 10 Furnace Cities in China	Sixth Tone & The Paper	"Many large cities in China, especially Chongqing, Wuhan and Nanjing, were traditionally known as “furnace cities”, suffer from long-lasing hot weather in summer. In recent years, with the global warming and china’s rapid industrialization, the ranking of “furnace cities” has changed dramatically. And more and more weather records were broken. It is an impression that even the “furnace cities” were getting hotter and hotter.This poster visualizes how the top ten “furnace cities” were getting hotter, and how they were hot in different ways. The upper part of the graphic shows the location of the top 10 furnace cities. Each one is with a circle chart , showing their monthly temperature anomalies (difference from 1971-2000 average) from Jan.1951 to May 2016. Orange line means the temperature is warmer than normal; Blue line means the temperature is cooler than normal. We found most of cities are getting warmer from 2000 and 2010. The middle chart shows the number of high temperature days from 1980 to 2012. Each red dot represents a day with its daily maximum temperature exceeding 35 degree; Each blue dot represents a day with its daily minimum temperature exceeding 28 degree. For example, Chongqing have experenced 67 high temperature days(≥ 35 ℃) in 2011, setting a record during from 1980 to 2012. We also found that although some cities didn’t have long-lasting hot days like Chongqing, cities like Wuhan had the hottest summer nights, as they had more nights with their night air temperature exceeding 28 degree. This means people living in these cites hardly have a break from suffering hot weaves in summer. The bottom chart The bottom chart shows the heat index(HI), air temperature and relative humidity of furnace cities from July to September of 2016. The red vertical line represents the actual daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature. The orange triangle area represents the heat index, which is an attempt to estimate the human-perceived equivalent temperature. The heat index is calculated with air temperature and relative humidity basd on the the heat index equation of NOAA. The gradient blue bar at the bottom represents the relative humidity, the higher the humidity is , the darker the blue is. For example, people in Chongqing might perceive a 63.5 degree temperature on July 20th in 2016. However, the actual maximum temperature of that day is 37.5 degree, with the relative humidity reached 74%. As most of top 10 ""furnace cities"" are in the southern part of China, which are usually humid, the levels of heat index of furnace cities in south are higher than their actual air temperature. Except for people living in Xi'an , the only northern city in Top 10 furnace cities. They are not feeling that much difference from the actual temperatures."

We calculated the average price of housing within 1km away from each metro station by collecting more than 300,000 housing data from public resources. Based on those works, we made a housing price-metro map which can be used as vivid guidance when people want to know a clear picture of housing market in Shanghai. Why it makes sense? Shanghai is a megacity with an area of 6340.5 square kilometers, it is common for people to live very far away from the work place. Saving commuting time occupies an important place when they consider where to live. Acting like blood vessels, 15 railways take lead responsibility for connecting all of the megacity’s districts. Living near one of the 366 metro stations is an effective way to reduce commute time. Buying and renting are different ways for people to get residency. The first map is based on the Shanghai metro map, the site locations on which are familiar to passengers but different from the actual position. The number close to the metro station name means the price per square meter on average of buying the second-hand apartments near it. The second map express the same topic except that it the offers interactions and the site locations are based on the actual conditions. The other two maps are based on the same map with the first one. The number besides the metro station on the third map means the rental fee of one room on average near the specific station. As to the circle on the last map, its size equals the number of the apartments for rent. According to the above four maps, you can easily know whether you can afford (buy or rent) an apartment near a metro station with limited budget and where is the reasonable place to live.

915	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/4012-meteor-impact-on-earth	Meteor Impact On Earth	Zona Kostic	Nick Bostrom has a very interesting paper called “Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority.” The basic intuition is that preventing even small risks of human extinction is worthwhile if we consider all the human generations it would save. One way to start saving future lives might be by digging into Meteorological Society dataset of every recorded meteor impact on Earth from 2500 BCE to 2012.  Previous records of epic meteor events leave us wondering: Are we living in a meteor peak period? Are we getting a better chance of seeing a splendid meteor shower? To understand the patterns of global meteor events, we decided to explore the dataset from two parameters: 1. The total mass per year. A bar chart was constructed in Tableau showing the sum of mass for each year. 2. The fallen percentage. The ratio of meteor events that were seen and were tracked down successfully. A graph visualizes two parameters using a shape resembling a real meteorite to enhance audience immersion. Existing data suggests that the probability of observing a meteorite is decreasing, so does the total mass of meteors that reach the ground per year. It is speculated that the reasons behind these due primarily to the lower atmospheric clarity than before and thicker cloud conditions where the meteorites are more likely to burn up. Even so, preparation is always a must. “We know for a fact the dinosaurs did not have a space program.” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said, quoting TV personality Bill Nye. “But we do, and we need to use it.” The entrant has supplied an additional file for this project: [1]	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Longlist;Science & Technology

Selecting different periods of a day these patterns can be compared to leisure or other bike usages. The graphic, created ad hoc from the raw data, aggregates the bike moves between the stations of the bike sharing provider within the selected period of a day. The result is shown in a graphic composed by 4 different elements. The start and end points are visualized by starburst charts where the rays of the chart are oriented towards the trip end or start. Start points are coloured in red, end points in green. The size of the rays represents the number of trips started towards the same end station, or being received from the same start station. The trips are shown by yellow vectors. The line width represents the number of trips between two stations. Trips with the same start and stop station are shown by circles. In the interactive version, the user can select different significant moments of a day and analyse the bike usage in relation to commuting patterns or leisure movement. The visualization includes data form 18. July 2018 to 24. July 2018 and covers the 7 days of a week.

There are more than 400 river water control points on the map. You can view up to 16 pollution parameters, as well as find out how its level has changed over five years. We have mapped the largest river basins in Ukraine. The user needs to click on one of the rivers basins in the menu on the left to start working with the map. After a click the map removes all the extra information and leaves only the chosen basin and icons (in the form of ""flower"") on it. The icons on the map indicate the places where employees of the State Agency of Water Resources take water for analysis. If the petals of ""flower"" are pink, then the pollution exceeds the norm. You can zoom the map with a double click. If you click on the icon, a new window with a graph and an enlarged ""flower"" appears on the screen. On the graph, you can track how the concentration of the pollutant has changed in the past and what it is now. As for the ""flower"", each of its petals represent a certain parameter for assessing the quality of water. On the petals can click to see the graph for the selected indicators. The blue color of the line graph means that the value is within the normal range. The pink part of the line may have different shades depending on how much the indicator exceeds the norm. The brighter the line, the greater the excess. The ""eye"" icon above the graphic will switch the display of a large flower to the version for users with visual impairments. In this version, the petals with a diagonal strip indicate improper quality of chosen indicator, and the petals with the point are of satisfactory quality. To return to the previous (small) scale, click on the mini-map of the chosen basin to the left of the main map. Above the map is the button ""Who is polluting the rivers in your area"". Click on it and select your area from the list. You will receive a list of enterprises that, according to the official data of the State Agency of Water Resources, pollute the rivers in your region. These enterprises are responsible for a significant part of the pollution in the rivers. Unfortunately, data on the exact coordinates of the places where they release pollutants are absent. You can also use the interactive instruction. The appropriate button ""Run an interactive instruction to using the map"" is in the lower right corner of the map. The mobile version only shows a general picture of the quality of water in the basins of the Ukrainian rivers, so we recommend viewing the project on a large screen (computer, laptop)."

942	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/4460-visualizing-religious-diversity-in-us-cities	Visualizing Religious Diversity In US Cities	Arushi Singh	Faith not only plays an important role in an individual’s life but also contributes a great deal in shaping societies. The increased movement of people across borders in search of better opportunities brings people of different faiths, religions, and value systems together. In fact, the debate on religious pluralism and tolerance is ever more important in today’s discourse. In particular, the major urban areas in the United States (US) have become the melting pot of diverse faiths. Thus, is there a way we can visualize this diversity of faiths beyond numbers and charts? Is there an underlying story that urban centers of the US tell about their religious diversity? In this visualization, I have used the places of worship as a proxy to represent religious diversity in the top 30 most populated cities of the US. The places of worship not only provide a safe space for the members of that faith but also allow them to exercise their religious freedom and preserve their value system in a foreign land. The visualizations presented here are designed in an abstract form of a networked mesh of the places of worship of different faiths. The purpose was not only to see them as quantities but also as a network of interconnected places and how they share space with other religious places of worship in large cities. As a result, each city explored here gets its own portrait of religious diversity that accounts for the geographical spread of the places, their quantity, and their relative position with the places other faiths. Each dot in the visualization represents a place of worship positioned on its longitude and latitude. It transforms these geolocations into Mercator projections and then connects them using a Delaunay triangulation. Religions are color-coded with major faiths included in the data being Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, and Islamic. The resulting “mesh” creates a unique portrait of each city depicting the spread, quantity, and co-existence of different places of worship. Though not exhaustive, it does give us some insight into how these shared spaces get formed in the cities creating these unique portraits: 1. Undeniably, Christianity is a major religion with a significant number and spread of its places of worship. Visually, this appears like an underlying mesh in the background of all the other places of worship of different faiths. 2. The overall spread of the religious places of worship seems proportional to the size of the city. Instead of creating small pockets, the places of worship, tend to take the shape of how big the city’s spread is. 3. Smaller cities tend to have higher shared spaces of different faiths compared to larger cities. In large cities, isolated pockets of places of worship of different faiths can be seen. 4. Population density also appears to be a driving factor of establishing places of worship, irrespective of the size of the city. It is possible that the size of the city only influences the spread of places of worship but the population density might influence the number of places.

This year one of the theme’s that was studied is loneliness. Analysis of open data on loneliness in the Netherlands shows a relation between loneliness and the need for domestic help. The interactive visual story shows the results of the analysis and explains the impact of this result. It explains the typical characteristics of people that feel lonely, and proves the fact that loneliness and the need for domestic help are related. This means that loneliness is not only a social problem in the Netherlands, but also has financial impact. Looking at the amount of money that is spent on a yearly basis on domestic help, this emphasizes the need for prevention of loneliness. There are several ways to prevent loneliness in order to avoid unnecessary cost for domestic help and other ways of care for people that feel lonely, but above all, decrease the loneliness rate in the Netherlands. Prevention of loneliness asks for customized solutions. This study provides insights that can support in defining the right approach for prevention and identifying loneliness at an earlier stage.

High quality education comes at a price in China, a high price indeed. In 2008, Beijing reformed its middle school enrollment system by eliminating subject based tests. They replaced it with the Nearby Enrollment Policy, where students living in the vicinity of schools can get higher chances to be enrolled. This caused housing prices and rentals surrounding famous schools to rise extremely quickly. This phenomenon in rising housing prices then led to housing near famous schools to be termed “Xuequfang”; School district based housing. “Xuequfang” or school district based housing is a term that people both love and hate. These houses are often small, overpriced and sometimes rundown apartments in the vicinity of these top competitive elementary schools. Despite this fact, prestige is what parents are most concerned about. As long as their child can be enrolled or admitted into the most prestigious school districts, their child will have more opportunities to enter a prestigious school. Moreover, their child can get to enjoy high quality education resources and there will be greater chances of getting admitted into good middle and high schools thereafter. ""Pay to Learn"" is a project that uses in-depth data analysis, graphs and interviews to illustrate the link between housing and quality education in Beijing. Apart from several detailed examples to show how extreme the price differences for ""Xuequfang"" can be, topics such as culture, asset speculation, and China's rising middle class will be explored to provide context and understanding to this phenomenon. In addition, data from real estate websites, schools and Beijing's education authority have been mined, analyzed, and summarized into graphs and illustrative maps - all of these organized in an attempt to understand the complications behind the science of ""Xuequfang""."

While many schools originated long before Confederation in 1867, the system was primarily active following the approval of the Indian Act in 1876 — a group of laws aiming to do away with the Indian tribal system and forcibly enfranchise First Nations peoples — until the the last federally-operated school closed in 1996. In recent years and in light of official apologies issued by the Government of Canada, individual provinces and territories, the Vatican, and various church groups, information about the schools and their students' welfare has become public knowledge: physical and sexual abuse was rampant, both involving administrators and between students; malnourishment and poor living conditions were not uncommon; and assimilation, deprivation of cultural traditions, and punishment was the standard. It is estimated that 6000 children died while in attendance. This project aims to investigate the IRS system visually, beginning with the stories of survivors and transitioning into the narrative of each school. Included are some 130 schools, 700+ reserves, tribes, and bands, and countless stories of residential school survivors.

It features user authentication, dataset caching, and an integrated administration interface for dataset management. Once data has been uploaded by a user, its appearance can be globally configured in a variety of ways. This includes setting the visibility of the various ""entity types"", specifying how their descendants appear (as linked nodes or ""packed""), and assigning them a color. Additionally, users can control whether others see the datasets they've uploaded through a public/private visibility setting. Currently, data upload support is limited to ATLAS.ti, however we hope to add support for additional qualitative data analysis programs in the future. Until that time, we hope support for the leading application in this domain gives the ENTITY MAPPER appeal to the qualitative analyst. ATLAS.ti's XML export can be used to export a project at anytime, and with this file new datasets can be easily added to the Entity Mapper (and existing ones updated).

Migration, ethnical identity are culturally created processes, which go back thousands of years and should not only be looked at from today's standpoint. Once we move away from the question, who is migrating today to the question who migrated the most. The countries who try to stop migration today are the biggest migrators themselves. Looking at these patterns alone is not enough. We still separate the world into countries. Creating borders where there are none. Borders are not given but created. Over the last thousands of years, people have drawn them into a world without borders. In our interconnected world, we should think twice about continuing this effort.

From the inception of the game, player performance has been quantified and the analysis has only grown more sophisticated with time to determine value and project both athletic and financial performance. The new management for the LA Dodgers has embraced a data-driven approach to reshaping one of baseball’s most legendary clubs. They sought a solution that could integrate the traditional scouting techniques that had defined the team’s recruitment for generations with the new breed of statistical analysis that has given rise to the term moneyball. The front office needed an efficient process to capitalize on the wealth of information inundating the staff; from the team’s internal proprietary scouting reports and medical data to the real-time flow of player salary and performance data provided by our data partner. In the highly competitive world of professional baseball operations, the objective was to make the data work for the team and, ultimately, provide a competitive advantage in how it approached transactions in the sport’s volatile player marketplace. The approach was to build an application framework that would allow the team to interpret varied player data sources and to develop and maintain a proprietary visualization system. Unlocking the raw player data first required our team to engineer a database linking separate, secured data structures, then develop APIs that enabled more sophisticated queries than previously possible. To achieve this, we needed to understand the existing data structures and consolidate them into a usable form that could be rendered through systematic design. Our data engineer worked with our front-end developers to create an efficient method for the application to call the data and display it within the interface. Our user experience, visual and information designers conceived a flexible system that could provide simple, clear results to complex queries. The execution balanced information density and legibility both on the desktop experience and the 17-screen display. This comprised the main innovation of the system: the ability to search, access, and display player information that had previously required analysts to manually gather, compile and display in printed form.

In this piece we highlight long-held critiques of maps as truthful depictions of the world.    We place our trust in maps as truthful representations: as tools to guide us from A to B. But all maps are partial depictions made of elements cartographers deem significant. The unimportant and superfluous are erased.  In this map we have freed the streets and roads of Newcastle-upon-Tyne from their physical location and relationship to familiar sites which orientate us, preserving only the connections to other streets and roads. Data was sourced from Ordnance Survey's MasterMap Integrated Transport Network dataset. This information was then manipulated in ArcMap and Gephi, a social networking software package. An algorithm was used to generate gravity within the data based on shared connections. Collections of roads which are linked to each other are pulled together, while those which aren’t are pushed apart.  The result is a topological road map which is truthful in terms of how roads are connected (you could use it to navigate the city), but time and space are uncoupled from the layout. Using this map as a navigational tool, then, is akin to following a satnav where you know where you are in relation to road connections, but not in terms of an embedded, multi-sensory connection to the city.  Newcastle is disclosed as clusters of streets of different shapes, sizes and densities, which represent districts of the city. By not disclosing landmarks the map disorientates us to reveal the importance of familiar, often highly personal, sites that play important roles in how we understand, navigate and feel about the city.  This map was first exhibited at en_counter, an exhibition of maps and map art at The Holy Biscuit Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne, May-June, 2016. For more details of the methodology see our forthcoming article in Environment and Planning A (pdf preview here).	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2016	Longlist;Data visualization

1024	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/4042-central-park-squirrel-census-2019-report-maps	Central Park Squirrel Census 2019 Report Maps	Squirrel Census	In October 2018, the first official Central Park Squirrel Census was conducted in New York City. The project — which involved 323 volunteer Squirrel Sighters and took two years to plan, execute, and present — was completed for many reasons: to learn more about the populations and behaviors of the Eastern gray; to tell a data-driven narrative about Central Park; to engage in community building; and to transform the space of Central Park into an art project and story that unfolded in real time. Throughout the project, from planning and data gathering to analysis and visualization, maps were a critical and essential tool. Led by Chief Cartographer Nathaniel G. Slaughter IV, the Squirrel Census team surveyed, ground-truthed, and mapped Central Park, producing one of the most detailed map databases of the park in the past 80 years. This database provided the structure from which two significant maps — both 5’ x 2.5’ — were generated, serving as the foundation for the Central Park Squirrel Census 2019 Report. The first, a park map, provides context for the census. Presenting the geographic and cultural systems of the park, this is the “terrestrial” map of the land and human experience. Hypsometric tinting blended with exposed bedrock creates a foundation for the map on which three primary communication systems — carriage roads, the Bridle Path, and footpaths — are placed. This circulatory network is interwoven through a complete catalog of arches and bridges and connects the park’s built-up areas — buildings, plazas, and hardscape gathering spots. Annotations are scale-dependent based on area and cultural significance and given different styles based on feature type. The map header includes lateral and longitudinal section diagrams, as well as a park index highlighting places of interest, statues and fountains, arches and bridges, playgrounds, and entrance gates. Park observations from census volunteers are also provided and linked to the map by hectare ID. Complementing the park map, the “celestial” map charts the location, distribution, and coloration of Central Park squirrels. Three thousand twenty-three squirrel sightings are shown with star-like symbols, and designated hues represent both primary and highlight fur coloration. The map’s color palette utilizes a primary background color; from this fulcrum referential park geometries are presented in darker colors, whereas lighter colors are allocated to census data. Spatial proximity of sighting points is shown through a three-tier series of clustering, the smallest of which emphasizes highly dense areas of sightings, while the largest tier shows sprawling-but-connected networks of squirrel activity. Twenty-three Clusters of Prominence have each been labeled, connected to a table showing number of sightings and cluster area, and given a name reminiscent of a Central Park league softball team. In addition, select squirrel observations noted during the count are linked to the map by hectare ID. Both maps — available in the Central Park Squirrel Census 2019 Report — are four-color, lithographic offset prints on 70 lb. Paper Tyger, and folded to 7.5” x 7.5”.

The project consist of a data artwork ""A Selfless Society"" responding to the colony behaviour and series of live data visualisations giving us a deeper understanding of the structure of the mole-rat colony. Naked mole-rats are unique among mammals, with unusual features that result from extreme adaptations to living underground. They have become an important model system for healthy aging, they resist cancer, they are studied to help us understand how complex societies evolve and are maintained, and even for how social environment can affect fertility. Studying an animal with what is at first glance a bizarre lifestyle, can inform us about more general biological principles of wide importance to us and other species. Each animal has a tag (a passive integrated transponder) implanted under it’s skin, the type vet’s put in dogs and cats but smaller. A series of sensors placed around the burrow detect when a tagged animal is close by. We log the tag ID, sensor ID, and exact time data on a server where we can retrieve it to calculate new data (such as speed) and create live animation. For the data artwork we used WebGL to create sketch like aesthetics while the infographics website is using HTML Canvas to create bespoke charts.

Despite harsh criticisms to violence intrinsic with the American society, numerous documentaries about Columbine, and school safety training efforts for both students and teachers, the problem of school shootings has only grown more and more prominent since then. School shooting is now such a usual accident that the news coverage of these events mutated, from tons of press releases regarding the Columbine massacre and some of the latest shootings barely getting a short piece on local newspapers. Is the big audience becoming accostumed to school shootings? How many of them have there been since Columbine, and how many of them have drew no notice at all?

1069	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/510-united-states-of-amoeba	United States of Amoeba	Kenneth Cukier	Everyone knows that American politics has become more polarised over the past quarter-century. In this motion infographic, the effect is shown visually—with troves of data, statistics and “force-directed graphing”, a technique to depict positions based on attraction-and-repulsion models adapted from physics. The network maps here look at the degree to which senators vote the same way over the course of a quarter-century. Each node is a senator. Links represent instances when senators have voted similarly on substantive legislation on at least 100 occasions during the same congressional session. Their intensity is the degree to which they vote the same. Their placement is determined algorithmically, based on their co-operation with other legislators—which has the effect of pushing more bipartisan ones to the centre. About 25 years ago, American policymaking looked like a tightly bound ball with lots of meshing in the middle, as senators regularly crossed the aisle to get things done. Over time the two sides have split apart, like an amoeba dividing, separating into distinct spheres that share little common voting. Though America’s political polarisation has become a fact of life, it has never been seen so graphically with data: as a diseased brain, with few neural pathways between the two hemispheres.

The divide is so large that even leading Australian education experts described the figures as “extraordinary”. Features previously unseen data. At the core of this investigation is My School data – one of Australia’s most tightly-held datasets on school resourcing. Numerous media outlets have attempted to scrape the data since the creation of the My School website in 2008. ABC News is the first to successfully scrape the full dataset. To verify the data, we worked closely with academic researchers familiar with the data. Ground-breaking analysis ABC News’ analysis is the most comprehensive and detailed to date, comparing the individual finances of nearly every school in Australia across a five-year period. This was the first year a representative analysis of income and spending was possible because: - A federal government program distorted spending patterns between 2008 and 2012, and - Capital spending varies significantly from year to year, so data needs to be normalised across a number of years Innovative visual storytelling Our visual language had two main aims: - To cut through the numbers by connecting the data with the reality on the ground – specifically, the schools and communities that readers know - To show how each of the 8,500 schools fit into the bigger picture; a story previously untold because the only data available were summary statistics. For the opening visualisation, we combed annual reports, school newsletters, fundraising brochures, P&C bulletins, campaign videos, architectural plans and development applications for dozens of schools The technical challenge of visualising 8,500 dots – particularly for our large mobile phone readership – required creative responses For example, we chose to avoid the distraction of interactivity in the opening visualisation. Instead we guided the audience through a “long-scroll” graphic by highlighting specific schools with GIFs, 3D fly-throughs, time-lapse videos, text and photos. This helped readers make the explicit connection between the data and the schools in their communities Crowdsourced data Our story went beyond the numbers, using online survey tool Screendoor to crowdsource data on the capital funding needs of schools across Australia This proved invaluable for reaching out to under-resourced schools, which are often prevented from speaking to media by government education departments or non-government sector authorities The survey collected data, photos and personal accounts from dozens of school principals, P&C committees, teachers, students, former students and parents Unprecedented database Lastly, we built an interactive database to show readers “personalised” data for their school, and present our data transparently The map allowed users to compare public and private funding and capital expenditure for any given school and its neighbours across the nine-year dataset The entrant has supplied multiple files for this project: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Shortlist;Outstanding Outfit;Longlist;Bronze;Winners;News & Current Affairs

The list includes those certified classics you’ve seen a million times—like Casablanca (1943) and Godfather II (1974)—and those forgotten gems buried in your Netflix queue. Rather than simply using reproductions of the movies' posters and promotional art as stand-ins for each film, we decided to to use minimalist icons representing notable images, props, or costumes from each film. For example, we used Scarlett O'Hara's red hoop skirt from Gone with the Wind (1939), Poor Yorick's Skull from Hamlet (1948), Jon Voight's Stetson jacket from Midnight Cowboy (1969), the silver dog tags from Platoon (1986), and the wind-blown plastic bag from American Beauty (1999).

Using historical data, Arranz explores the sea route plied by Spanish galleons to establish trade with China. These European vessels became known as China Ships. They transported silver from the Americas to exchange for goods in Asia, mostly commodities of Chinese origin. Arranz explains how Spain was able to capitalise on China’s insatiable appetite for silver through its colonial mint in the Bolivian city, Potosi, which mined an estimated 60% of the world’s ilver by the late 16th century. The trade of silver between China and Europe via the Americas, mainly through the use of Spanish pieces of eight, continues to influence today’s currencies with establishment of the silver ‘dollar’ as the first universal currency. Cultural interchange between continents followed. The first overseas Chinese neighborhoods were built in Manila and Mexico City. Chinese vendors sold Asian goods at competitive prices. Customers could discover fine Chinese porcelain, diamonds, ivory, fabrics from China and other Asian countries, rubies, emeralds, spices from the Moluccas and many other exotic Asian goods. Asia’s oldest operational university was established in Manila in 1611. Books began to be translated and published from Chinese into European languages as early as 1586. Chinese fabrics were highly prized and influenced fashion and design. Over the years Chinese shawls became fashionable throughout Europe, especially in 19th century Paris. The reverberations of these discoveries continue to be felt today. In Spain, the Manila shawl, which has Cantonese origins, is still a must-have for flamenco dancers.

As a leading non-profit organization dedicated to changing the lives of children in need around the world, Save the Children's goal was to raise awareness and consciousness in G-8 nations of the severity of the problem. The campaign was designed to boldly capture the attention of world leaders and the general public and visually communicate the impact of malnutrition on a child's physical and mental development. By showing the data in the familiar food nutrition label format, the viewer was better able to see how the lack of basic nutrition in one country contributes to life-threatening disease and child death, especially when compared to the data the American reader usually sees in a food nutrition label. The infographic was featured on Save the Children's website and social media sites and challenged viewers to compare this food label with a food label of their next meal.

July 2019 was one of the warmest months ever recorded - and July temperatures almost everywhere on Earth have been higher in the last decade compared with 1880-1900. The BBC Visual and Data Journalism team explored how the temperature has changed in 1,000 major cities across the world how much it could increase by in the coming years in a compelling, animated, visual scrolling web experience.  A spinning globe at the top of the page visualises how July temperatures have changed already in the past 100 years, with an interactive search lookup below allowing the audience to find out how much the area around their city has already warmed and what may lie ahead.  What is unique to this project is how it goes beyond analysing and visualising global average temperatures and rises of 1.5C and 2C. In doing so, the piece visualises changes in actual temperatures for January and July, which for many locations represent the height of summer and winter. These figures are more relevant and relatable to the audience rather than the global average.  The story also goes on to look at the potential impact of climate change on three very different locations: the Indonesian megacity of Jakarta, the US state of New York, and the Arctic.   The team worked hard to ensure that the page was accessible to all users, carrying out testing internally before launch. The testing included checking the content using a screen reader, as well as implementing an animation toggle at the top of the page to enable readers with vestibular impairments to turn off the animations.  The BBC's data journalists worked closely with climate scientists to develop the methodology for the data analysis and ensure it was statistically and scientifically accurate.  The project was translated into 27 languages and promoted across different BBC World Service language sites such as Hindi, Swahili, Arabic, Korean and Russian.

This was a mammoth undertaking, not having read the book before. The novel needs to be made more accessible, especially to us Dubliners, so I hope this helps. An animated narrative was overlaid onto a map of the city as described in the novel. Included was a visualisation of the Gilbert schema which Joyce wrote to help his friend, Stuart Gilbert, understand the structure of the book.

The impact of climate change is particularly significant for our coastal regions, which will have to deal with rising sea levels as well as increased temperatures and weather events. The National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility plays an important role in educating Australian councils and communities, especially in coastal regions, about adapting to climate change. They wanted to produce a series of infographics that would help to communicate their key messages. We worked together with researchers from the National Climate Change Adaptation Authority to identify key concepts that local councils might need to understand when they started to grapple with coastal climate change. These support a number of more complex tools that allow users to assess their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and develop new planning and management approaches to deal with these impacts. We developed a series of infographics explaining topics such as ""What are RCPs?"", ""Why is sea level rise important?"" and ""What are the options for adapting to sea level rise?"" With each infographic, we worked on an overarching narrative or information hierarchy, and developed symbols or categories to try and break the information into bite-size chunks. The information and icons were designed to present information clearly and succinctly, and to trigger further action by councils."	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Maps, Places & Spaces

Here’s how they covered it.	Vox	The past week of Trump scandals for people reading mainstream news outlets has gone something like this: President Trump fired the FBI director who was investigating his campaign’s connection with Russia — and then the next day, Trump shared classified information with Russian officials. But on conservative news outlets, the narrative was very different. It was about an FBI director whose firing was long overdue, and a liberal media desperate to take down Trump. To pinpoint exactly how this played out for a reader visiting only conservative-leaning sites, we analyzed the front pages of Breitbart.com and FoxNews.com and compared them with NYTimes.com. We wrote a program to screenshot the front pages of these sites every three hours after the Comey firing using the Wayback Machine’s internet archives.

Each small coffee ring circle represents a time coffee was seen with each large coffee ring representing a time when it was spoken. For this project, I collected my data by hand whilst watching the series and later transferred it onto a spreadsheet. I also noted down the speech that was spoken about coffee. I then decided to visualise this data by using coffee as my material, this included marking intentional coffee rings to represent times when I had seen coffee, or it had been spoken about in the series. I decided to spit up my visualisation into episodes, to make it possible to compare which episodes had the most coffee references. I also added additional annotations of what was spoken, I feel that this added an extra depth to the piece. In the future, I would consider adding more details, perhaps extra context of why some episodes included more coffee than others. I also feel that it could be interesting to explore in more depth who speaks/drinks coffee the most in the series. This project was very fun to create, I especially enjoyed using physical materials to mark my data, and liked the organicness of how every coffee ring had some natural variance and uniqueness.

1160	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/315-growth-rings	Growth Rings		Businesses can take one of four paths to growth: They can acquire new customers, increase loyalty and new spend, innovate new products and services or enter new markets. One of the oldest ways to measure growth is through Dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating; and visualizing a slice of a company's history as tree rings allows us to identify some of the key paths they have used to drive growth over time. When we can clearly see these paths, it's possible to understand where a company's focus has lied, how they have (or haven't) changed their growth strategies, and where they have been most successful. We call these cross-sections Growth Rings. We've mapped the Growth Rings of three leading companies to illustrate the four paths to growth, and to help inspire growth in other corporations. What we like most about this project is that we believe no one has ever visualized the complex nature of a company's growth in such a simple, beautiful way.

From the first kick to the last, football is flooded with datapoints giving fresh insights into player and team performance. But action on the pitch is only part of the experience. Passionate fan energy can power a team forward and change the course of a game. By responding to every change of possession, questionable decision or missed chance, the fans give us the perfect lens through which to reimagine the game. Signal Noise partnered with Siemens for a world-first - ‘Reimagine the game’ - which allows football fans to view FC Bayern matches by listening to thousands of data points captured within key moments in the game. Using incredibly precise audio detection technology, we created a 3D soundscape that maps the noise within the Allianz Arena. We then analysed the fan noise alongside match data to identify interesting narratives and surface new perspectives on ‘fan energy’ and its interplay with on-pitch performance.

Data alone can’t easily answer this question, however there are data points which can add to the conversation. So, when Head of Creative, Mark Johnstone, stumbled across The Range Place (an online community who curate data on the vocal ranges of a huge number of singers), he was keen to see what the data revealed. Whilst the data on the site is fascinating, it’s not displayed in a readily digestible format, which makes a comparison of the various vocalists’ ranges difficult. The data was crying out to be visualised. The first challenge was deciding which vocalists to include. We liked the idea of comparing popular contemporary singers alongside those who’ve stood the test of time. The Rolling Stone's ‘100 Greatest Singers of All Time’ combined with those nominated for the upcoming Billboard Music Awards served as our seed list. The data revealed that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose has a greater vocal range than Mariah Carey. We knew we had a great story, the next step was to bring it to life. The most challenging aspect of the piece was making an abstract concept like vocal range readily understandable to those without an academic background in music. The introduction of the keyboard helped bring concreteness, as users can see just how large a vocal range each singer has. We also wanted to make the piece easy to explore, so we included the option for users to sort the list of vocalists by vocal range, highest notes and lowest notes. Almost half the traffic to ConcertHotels.com comes from mobile devices. As such, it was imperative that the content was easy to consume regardless of the device it was viewed on. We elected to design the piece mobile-first (i.e. we designed the mobile version before tackling the desktop version) in order to ensure a great user experience on mobile. The primary purpose of the project was to create a piece of content which would appeal to music lovers of all ages and garner online coverage to increase search visibility and brand recognition for ConcertHotels.com. The piece went far further than we thought possible. To date, it has been featured on more than 1,300 sites including Rolling Stone, Huffington Post, The Guardian, Telegraph, USA Today, Daily Mail, NBC and Time. Within 48 hours of launch the piece had been viewed over 1 million times on the ConcertHotels site and has attracted more than 2.5 million visits since launch. The piece was also widely shared with over 112,000 Facebook interactions, over 5,000 tweets and best of all, Axl Rose commented on the piece. We’ll leave you with a few words from our client: “I was so impressed with the Distilled team throughout the process, and the results they’ve achieved are incredible. I’m a huge Guns N' Roses fan, and having Axl himself comment really was the icing on the cake.” ~ Michael Kelly, Concert Hotels	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2015	Longlist;Data visualization

1200	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2288-hurricane-harvey-sos-rescue-map	Hurricane Harvey SOS Rescue Map	Andrew Hull	Living in Texas, I had spent hours watching news coverage as Harvey made landfall and slowly crept its way inland towards my city. Fortunately Austin was spared, but as the bayous in Houston started to overflow, my wife and I donated some money and supplies to aid the relief effort. Still, the more I continued to see the disaster unfold, the more I was hollowed out by the feeling of seeing suffering and not knowing how else to help. Unable to sleep, I stumbled upon a Facebook Live broadcast by a pair of rescuers who stayed up all-night boating through neighborhoods making contact and saving as many people as they could. The pair--David Odom & Morgan Murphy--had hauled their boat from Bastrop, a town a few miles downriver from Austin. Even though their town had itself been flooded, they recognized where help was needed most and answered the call. They were not broadcasting to Facebook to put their heroism on display, but rather to let their families know that they were safe. I was awestruck and inspired not only by their courage and selflessness--but also the way their cheerful demeanor calmed the very scared people they were saving. It was at this point I realized that this little couple from just down the road--along with hundreds like them--were some of the greatest American heroes I’d ever witnessed. Later that day, I came across a tweet referencing a spreadsheet where thousands of rescue requests were being logged. With David & Morgan in mind, I was curious to see how all of these requests could be coordinated and made useful to the autonomous fleet of volunteer rescuers. There was obviously no time to waste. With each minute that passed, dozens of calls for help were added to the list. I decided to use the data in the spreadsheet to make an interactive map that would show all requests as soon as they were entered. The tool that best fit this need was Tableau. Within thirty minutes, I had built the first iteration of a map and posted it to a live portal. Hoping that it would be useful to the boaters, I shared it with the group of strangers that were managing the data; and, before I knew it, I was part of a very different type of rescue team. Working with HarveyRescue has been unlike anything I’ve experienced in my life. The team is a spontaneous collective of people from across the world who have very little in common--other than the fact that they each recognized there actually is something they could do to help. It cannot compare to the heroism of people like David & Morgan, but it does save lives. As social media and open platforms continue to become more prevalent in society, it is likely that collaborative efforts like HarveyRescue will become more common and more effective than rigid disaster response efforts we’ve come to rely on. Hopefully, fewer people will use phrase “I wish there was something I could do” to reassure themselves in times of disaster. They actually have a channel to make a difference. On top of being utilized by the hundreds of volunteer boats that were rescuing folks, the map became a critical tool for the rescue efforts of the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the Houston Fire Department. In all, it contributed to the documented rescue of over 5000 people in Houston and its surrounding area.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Politics & Global;Longlist

The fraternity of bond jockeys, derivatives mavens and stock pickers who've long personified the industry are giving way to algorithms, and soon, artificial intelligence. Although much has been previously reported on technology’s potential to displace work, the focus has almost exclusively been on blue-collar jobs in manufacturing and service industries. What tasks currently performed by the high-earners in finance might also be automatable? And when? To find out, Bloomberg reporters conducted in-depth surveys at top investment banks and fintech firms, gathering exclusive insight into how they plan to be—or are already—incorporating artificial intelligence. Responses were placed into four broad categories, ordered based on the likelihood of automation. To visualize it, we borrowed visual tropes from an adjacent field within machine learning: computer vision. Boxes tracking human faces add discomfort, while level of opacity was used to signify the likelihood of automation, thereby obscuring this representation of the workers who might be displaced.

Gómez Celis	People living with HIV are around 20% times more likely to develop Tuberculosis than persons without this disease. Tuberculosis is the most common illness among people living with HIV, including those who are taking an antiretroviral treatment. Also it is the major cause of HIV-related deaths. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of the dual epidemic, accounting for approximately 86% of all deaths from HIV-associated TB in 2016. These numbers aim to create a collaboration between tuberculosis and HIV programmes, trying to reduce the burden of patients among people living with HIV and the burden of HIV among TB patients.  Through this micro visualisation, it is intended to explore certain aspects of the relationship of these diseases over time. We have used a line representation that plays with three different variables: slope, width and color.  For the lines with the blue scale: tuberculosis patients with known HIV status (%), Tested tuberculosis patients HIV positive (%) and HIV-positive tuberculosis patients on ART ( antiretroviral therapy) (%). For the ocher scale, three other variables are analysed: Incidence of tuberculosis (per 100.000 population), Tuberculosis treatment coverage (%), and number of deaths due to tuberculosis among HIV negative patients (per 100.000 population). The trends of these two groups of variables are compared based on: a) A global view. b) Depending on the geographic area for the regions contemplated by World Health Organisation: Africa, America, Europe, South-east Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific. c) and the third one, in which we also compare the trend based on their income level.

Every year, millions come to Google to search for news and information that helps illuminate the world around them. While people often search for breaking news, the latest sports scores, or what's playing at a local movie theater, they also often look for answers on how to fix the more mundane items around them. Recently, we noticed that “how to…” searches have increased by more than 140% since 2004, and much of that search interest is directed towards how to “fix” things—whether it’s a lightbulb, window, washing machine, or even the toilet. In fact, “How to fix…” is consistently near the top of the list of most common queries, year after year, around the world.

The first one was Philadelphia, estimated to be the biggest city in the country at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. However, by the time of the first U.S. Census in 1790, New York City had surpassed Philadelphia by a few thousand residents – and the Big Apple has stayed the largest in the country ever since. This infographic - designed for Liberty Cruise - ranks the 10 most populous cities in the United States for every decade since 1790. It's amazing that some of the biggest cities in the late 18th century hosted no more than 6,000 residents. And two of them were in Rhode Islands, one of the less populated states today. Jumping forward 200 years, New York has not lost its top spot, mainly because it absorbed Brooklyn in 1898. However, the list has changed a lot regarding the following positions, with the raise of some western metropolis (painted in green) like Los Angeles, Houston, and Dallas.

Using data from the 2011 Census, I was able to represent each person as a single dot - that's almost 7 million for London alone! I applied colour to reveal religious allegiance, making the map a multivariate dot density. Dot density maps are really effective at normalising data by geographic area. This is because places with fewer people fade away, while densely populated areas become more prominent. These visualisations help to reveal hidden patterns, or in this case, communities. They not only look interesting, but help to make the data more meaningful. Historically, London has been predominantly Christian. This is evident as the map is a sea of blue. Islam, London's second largest religion and represented here as turquoise, seems to have a greater following north of the River Thames. The map also reveals large Jewish, Hindu and Sikh communities - all found to the north and west of the capital. I didn't include those who don't identify as religious - the idea of the map was to show religious communities.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Maps, Places & Spaces;Longlist

The two main release strategies, platform and wide, are concepts known by some film fans and industry insiders, but not to a larger audience. Previously, without a macro view of these release strategies, it was difficult to visualize the consistent patterns used by film studios across years. Using clear data visualizations we created insightful, illuminating takeaways for readers. We had to be innovative in how we made a largely markets-focused audience interested in an entertainment story. The numerous charts and data-driven elements of this story made it easier to bridge that gap. We believe it created many 'ah-ha' moments because it is a concept that is relatable to millions of people, but is rarely visualized. This project used modern data journalism and design tools (Scrollama.js, d3.js, and R) to let the data tell the story. The simplicity of a column chart and two main color choices allowed the reader to discern easily the patterns and meanings behind them. We chose to present the data as ""small multiples"" so that we could achieve two goals at the same time: to easily highlight the patterns and insights we've identified in the data; and to give readers the opportunity to explore the full data on their own. We believe we met the goal of illustrating these patterns and creating a quick takeaway for readers – 7 out of 8 Best Picture Winners used a platform release (this was later updated to 8 out of 9 after ""The Shape of Water"" won)."

The graphic incorporates unique details of each flight, like floating rodents and exploding boosters, to help tell the story of SpaceX’s successes and failures. The piece also includes interactive easter eggs, like rockets that launch and gracefully return to earth when clicked on. One problem this graphic had to overcome was the need for a complex key. We needed to display more than a dozen icons, each requiring a somewhat lengthy description due to the complexity of defining the nuances of space travel.  To overcome these challenges, we instead incorporated the definitions into a short story that utilized rebus techniques — where illustrations are used in lieu of words and phrases — to quickly move the readers through the definitions. The symbols are then replicated throughout the piece, and as the complexity of each SpaceX mission grows, so does the string of symbols guiding you through each launch.

While the ""storm-induced baby boom"" may be one of the most popular urban legends, the internet is frequently abuzz about what factors play a role in the timing of births. Evolutionary biology, World Series victories, terrorist activity, changing seasons, large storms, climate change, Superbowl wins, the idea that people don't like having sex when it's too hot...the list of potential culprits goes on and on.

1282	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/570-bpy-beats-per-year	BPY – Beats Per Year		The digitalization of todays society emerges into nearly all aspects of our lives. Musicians, dj‘s and producers mainly use digital music formats nowadays. Digital music files and current dj technologies contain and generate large quantities of data alongside their audio signal itself.  This project tries to take a closer look at these digital data which are included in common mp3 files and generated by any dj software. It creates a personal „dj diary“ which is extracted from the meta information of all songs played within several public dj sets. The application visualizes these data „on the fly“ in various measurements using web technologies such as html, css and javascript.  The data record is taken from a song history which originates from the dj software Serato Scratch Live. It contains every song title, artist name, bpm value, genre, chronological information and further meta information of any song played by „gramufon a.k.a. Dj Genos“ in his dj sets during the years 2010 to 2013.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2014	Longlist;Interactive Visualization

South Korea, my home country, in my memory wasn't the society that welcomes outsiders. I started wondering about where Korea stands today. Has it become more diversity-embracing than how I remember? I hope this small piece of visualisation that will build up to a larger piece gives a clue. A translation of the Korean text presented with the visualisation: South Koreans' attitude towards immigrants According to 2017 census, immigrants make up 2.9% of South Korean population, which suggests the nation is multicultural by the UN's definition. Along with low birth rate and aging, a rise in the number of immigrants is driving structural societal changes in Korea. Nonetheless, with a long history (or a myth) of being monoethnic, many Koreans still think that monoethnicity is a key part of national identity.  So today do Koreans see foreigners living in Korea for study, work or family as members of their society? (2015) includes the survey results of 4,000 adults to holistically capture Koreans' view on the topic of multicultural society and immigration. Among a range of questions, the chart presents the response to one question that summarises where Korea stands: 'Would you like to have immigrants as neighbours?' Yes or No.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	People, Language & Identity

Big stars mean a higher ranking, the color shows the mood (orange=happy/blue=bad), and the placement of the stars (the higher up) shows if a song is danceable. There are filters available e.g. all 1st places, or only Swiss songs. Also all available videos and covers are shown. Over the decades you can zoom in on an annual basis.

1367	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3808-harvest-chart	Harvest Chart	Type/Code	The Harvest Chart visualizes the weekly crop harvest of fruits and vegetables across the United States in an interactive data visualization. The design objective for the project was to answer a simple question: what produce is growing near me right now? Using weekly crop harvest data reported by the USDA and NASS, along with supplemental crop season data from the NRDC and various state agricultural organizations, the weekly percentage of each crop’s full seasonal yield is visualized in a streamgraph that can be filtered by state and crop type. The Harvest Chart reveals the seasonal ebb and flow of each crop’s availability within a given region, and the aggregate seasonal harvest trends across multiple crops within a region. Each crop is assigned a representative color to be easily identified at a glance, with specific weekly values revealed when hovering over each crop’s stream. When filtering the data across multiple states concurrently (averaging each crop’s yield across states), one can explore crop availability across wider multi-state regions, telling a more comprehensive story of what local produce will likely be available at a farmer’s market during any given week of the year. Multiple sorting options are available, to sort crop alphabetically, by “peak” harvest week, or by crop color. The Harvest Chart was initially conceived as a print design project, however, after collecting the data (about 110 crops, across 50 states, for each week of the year) and prototyping various visualization approaches, we ended up needing to develop custom software to efficiently and accurately explore various data permutations and visualization approaches. The web application was developed with Django to facilitate the data logic and a simple content management system, and the interface leverages the D3 visualization library. After creating a print design for the crop data of Northeast states in the US, the web application has now been publicly launched for anyone to explore. The Harvest Chart was created as an experimental side project at Type/Code, a digital product studio, as part of an ongoing series of data visuzlation experiments.

This is what designer Valentina D'Efilippo and researcher Miriam Quick set out to explore in OddityViz – a visual deconstruction of David Bowie’s 1969 track ‘Space Oddity’. Data and design come together in an attempt to visualize the song’s grammar and explore how musical and narrative structures can lead to various interpretations. Musical and interpretative data from the track were visualized on a set of ten engraved records, paired with large scale prints and projections that draw from the song's fragmented, interstellar world. Each 12-inch disc deconstructs the track in a different way by visualizing one aspect of the song at a time, such as its instrumentation, rhythm, melody, harmony, lyrics, structure or story. The final disc in the series visualizes the emotions people experienced as they listened to the song. The data sculptures, large-scale posters and interactive window display were exhibited at Wieden+Kennedy London in January 2017 to mark the first anniversary of Bowie’s death. The installation aimed to start a new conversation about Bowie’s iconic track and to inspire viewers to revisit his music anew.

Launched in September 2017, it is the largest public searchable data dashboard dedicated to UK feature films. Visitors to the dashboard can chart the development of film and the people that make it over the decades, discovering facts such as who the most prolific actor is from each generation and what genres are the most popular. The Filmography has launched with a focus on revealing stories around gender. The homepage features curated charts that reveal information on topics such as the relationship between gender balance and genre and the rise of female film contributors over time. The BFI hope that by revealing these stories, the Filmography Dashboard will open up conversations around gender in film that will help to move the industry forward, encouraging filmmakers to make decisions that promote diversity. The biggest technical challenge was processing the data (more than 10,000 films featuring around 250,000 individuals with over 630,000 credits) so it could be queried in real time. To facilitate this, data was imported from the BFI’s API and stored in a Mongo database. Custom D3.js code was used to build a set of reusable chart components that could be populated with data specific to the users filters.

1434	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1536-cities-in-europe	Cities in Europe	PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency	Cities in Europe – Facts and figures on cities and urban areas The publication ‘Cities in Europe’ contains 13 infographics that show facts and figures on recent urban developments in the context of the ‘Europe 2020 strategy’ and the ‘Urban Agenda for the EU’, which aims to strengthen the urban dimension in the European Union. Given the complexities of the urban challenges facing us, we need to explore the opportunities for cross-border collaboration and multi-level coordination. Exploration of new strategies, plans and practices requires, among other things, high-quality data, thorough analysis and clear communication. Visualizing information, e.g. by using infographics or interactive websites, can play a vital part in creating and sharing knowledge. Based on the harmonised definition of urban areas by Eurostat and the OECD, European cities are compared with each other and recent trends are described, such as those in migration, demographic change, risk of urban poverty and urban-rural divergence in employment growth. In ‘Cities in Europe’ different forms of visualizing information (3D mapping, treemap charts, sankey diagrams, pie charts and bar charts) have been combined with compact explanatory text passages to create a better understanding of complex urban developments through time. Next to the printed publication and the pdf version, we have developed a ‘onepager’ for the web containing a selection of interactive visualizations.

Moliwood won 4 out of 4 matches as a pairing and earned themselves a place in the record books. This was the first time a European pairing had gone 4-0 on the first two days of the Ryder Cup, and Tommy Fleetwood was also the first rookie to achieve this. This poster, designed in collaboration with the team at the 15th Club, celebrates the amazing performance by Molinari and Fleetwood and the role data analytics played in the selection of wildcard picks and the optimisation of European pairings.

1466	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3114-bury-your-tropes	Bury Your Tropes	San José State University	Since 1970’s, there has been a steady increase in LGBT characters on television, a trend that is generally viewed as positive and progressive. Yet writers often have trouble doing the lives of queer people justice; character storylines, especially those about women, are often modeled after tropes and stereotypes. The aim of this infographic is to bring awareness about the unfair treatment and portrayal of queer female characters on television between 1972 and 2017. Research shows that the quantity of queer women has gone up while the quality of their stories has been largely questionable. Most often, these characters are used to boost ratings only to be written off. There is a disconnect between the perceptions of straight people and the portrayal of LGBT experiences, likely due to the misconception that television is purely entertainment. The reality is that shows are meaningful to their audiences. The actions taken by fictional characters are reflective of our identity and how we are perceived by others. As a bisexual woman, the representation of non-heterosexual orientations on television has become very important to me over the years. This graphic shines light on queer women in the media over the past four decades by visualizing the increased quantity of characters over the years in addition to the quality of their stories, and significant events (both in real life and on television) that have influenced viewers. Through this visual display of information I encourage show writers to do more with our stories. Better representation is about true diversity, complete honesty, and accuracy above all else. LGBT people are everywhere, and they shouldn’t have to change or hide themselves to land a part on our beloved shows.

1499	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/397-paper-cuts-motion-infographic	Paper Cuts motion infographic	Bill Schulz, Lou Saldivar, John Schmid	Many of the defining forces of our time â€” the rise of the digital age, the globalization of the economy, the decline of American competitiveness â€” can be understood through one simple thing: a sheet of paper. If that paper came from Wisconsin, the nation's top papermaking state, it is the product of a tight, local economy that has supported families and sustained communities for 150 years. The industry was built on the state's lush forests and rushing rivers, on the pride of fine craftsmanship and the power of constant innovation. Wisconsin mills launched the mass production of glossy paper and with it the rise of magazines. They created carbonless paper, pioneered strides in recycling, established the practice of renewable forestry. For generations, they produced paper for Bibles, best sellers. That led to a powerful sister industry â€” commercial printing â€” and the spinoff of household products, from Kleenex to disposable diapers. But that sheet of paper may no longer be from Wisconsin â€” or even the United States. It is now possible to cut down a tree in a Wisconsin forest, ship the pulp 3,000 miles around the world to China and watch it come back as high-quality paper that costs less than paper produced in the local mill. How can that be? That simple question drove the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's “Paper Cuts” series, a masterful, multimedia look at the effect of global economics on one of the state's cornerstone industries. In print and online, through penetrating stories, stunning photos, compelling videos and innovative graphics, a team of journalists provided readers with an unprecedented look at how the paper industry, already battling the threat of computers and iPads, now faces a more potent one from a country with a severe shortage of trees. The project took readers to the forests of northern Wisconsin to the boardrooms of New York hedge funds. And it took readers â€” for the first time â€” inside China's relentless drive to become the world's biggest paper power. After tripling production over the last decade, China has surpassed U.S. production and can now match the annual output of all of Wisconsin's mills in the span of three weeks. Reporter John Schmid and photojournalist Mike De Sisti traveled to China with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit that funds foreign travel to help journalists tell untold stories. The narrative lays bare the competitive position of the United States in a stark and revealing way. The “Paper Cuts” project is especially noteworthy for its cross-platform approach, one that is a model for today's multimedia journalism. The team â€” including interactive designer Emily Yount, graphic artist Lou Saldivar and designer Nick Lujero â€” told each piece of the story in the manner best suited for doing so, without forcing them into conventional, print-driven formats. A look at the distorted economic loop became a motion graphic. The history of the industry became an interactive map, connecting local changes to global trends. The print vs. digital comparison became an online carbon calculator.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Motion infographic

People belonging to different age groups are seen hanging around in the square, most likely around the food stalls. The central courtyard, used for parking vehicles, is surrounded by a series of shops on the North, East and South. There are smaller food junctions towards the entrance, in the West, where the crowd is mainly seen. The market opens at 10 in the morning, but the crowd is seen only after 11 am. Students visit in the morning, while the officials visit in the noon. The actual business starts only in the evening. People start pouring in larger numbers as the sun hides below the horizon. The vendors have a great time selling goods till late at night and wrap up by 11pm of week days. Weekends are a boon to these vendors. The crowd on weekends is twice as much of that on weekdays and the market is open till 12 in the midnight. To understand the role of such public squares in a city, I observed both – tangible and intangible aspects of the place to represent them through maps. The below illustrated map is from the theme of mapping the movement of animals and birds The least considered and observed visitors are the animals and birds. This place has its own importance of birds and animals as localities take care of them. Pigeons are regular visitors and are fed by the shopkeepers every morning. The map illustrates the movement of pigeons at its peak in the public square at early mornings when the human interference is minimum.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Unusual;Longlist

It visualises for the very first time literally traveling from everywhere to everywhere on this planet. Do all roads lead to Rome? This is the question which inspired our project “Roads to Rome” (Dec 2015) and its successor “Flights to Rome” (Jun 2018). The proverb “all roads lead to Rome” is, by a closer look, a very interesting suggestive mobility statement. The goal of R2R was to find an automated way to visualize this saying. F2R addresses two additional aspects which the authors couldn’t figure out for the first iteration of the project back in 2015: 1. from really everywhere to everywhere on a global scale and 2. intermodal traveling of more than a single (road) mode of transport.

1512	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/4-the-pictolexis-communication-system	The Pictolexis Communication System	Fay Hart	I created this system as a piece of functional information design for people that have difficulty with verbal communication, often as a result of disabilities such as autism or those that impact upon motor skills. After much research, I found that many of the existing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) symbol systems are so basic that they do not reflect the user's intellect or indeed give them a chance to recognise more complex symbols. At first I was keen to create an exact representation of the existing symbols' meanings but I felt this approach would not benefit AAC users that are of high intellect and merely use symbols to save them spelling every letter of each individual word. This system was composed to make communication for these people more effective and to maximise the speed of communication, as existing communication methods can be quite time consuming for both the user and the person who is trying to understand the user's communication.  Having been keen initially to make these symbols exact representations, I discovered after studying orienteering maps, that the symbols depicted were not exact representations of the objects or geographical positions associated with the activity. However, because this was a form of communication that had a key and could be learned, the abstract concept worked. This was something I was then keen to develop within my work, with a view to these symbols being taught and heavily reinforced. Therefore, to create some consistency as a result of changing the face of the existing symbols, I decided to maintain a colour code similar to that of the existing Fitzgerald Communication System. This was to give existing users a familiar way of identifying these PictoLex symbols, despite their appearance being of great contrast to the current AAC pictograms. I also retained a simple colour palette, so that the symbols could be easily reproduced and inverted for those that have difficulty perceiving colour. Moreover, maintaining this palette allows successful photocopying, as the symbols are still clear and legible without the colour code. In addition, the simple colour composition is also helpful to those who do not have access to extensive editing software or wish to use other colour codes.  Overall, taking the aforementioned elements into account, I feel I have successfully devised a system that has the capacity to improve forms of self-expression for those that are unable to communicate verbally. However, if I had more time, I would endeavor to make the concept of the system more extensive by increasing the number and subject of symbols, to provide the user with more options for communicating, as well as opening up the world in which they are able to inform society about themselves and their communication.

1529	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1073-echoes-of-a-baby-boom	Echoes of a ba	boom	In 1918, the First World War ended and millions of men returned from the front line to their wives and sweethearts. Two years later, Britain experienced a sudden spike in birth rate, a ‘baby boom’, during which the number of births in England and Wales leapt by 45% from the wartime low. One consequence of that sudden arrival of a generation can be seen echoing across successive decades. Those original baby boomers grew up, led lives of their own, grew old, and eventually, inevitably, they began to die. And because there were so many of them to begin with, this generation has exerted a huge influence on the age structure of our population for the past half century. Our submission visualizes data from the Office of National Statistics, revealing a striking pattern in the number of deaths registered between 1963 and 2013: the effect of the large post-war generation ageing and dying. In each year, there is a drop in recorded deaths among people born in 1918 and a peak in recorded deaths among people born in 1920. During the past 50 years, a clearly-visible, wave-like pattern has emerged and come to dominate mortality data for England and Wales, highlighting the influence of this massive post-war cohort. And that’s not the end of the story. You may be able to spot the beginnings of a similar pattern: the echoes of the Second World War baby boom starting to propagate in the last decade as time begins to catch up with those born during the post-war years. After that, it may be another decade or two before we start to see the effects of the prolonged peak in births during the 1960s. As options for medical intervention multiply and people die later in life, from an evolving array of diseases, the impact of these large cohorts on healthcare provision is likely to be substantial.

On such a complex issue, we kept the visualization types and the descriptive texts as simple as possible while staying true to the data. The census visualization features a series of simple charts to dissecting the topic, rather than combining everything in a single complex visualization. The news visualizations features recognizable keywords, people and terms, so the user can focus on the change over time and the difference between sources. The project helps the Migration Observatory in communicating its independent research in support of a balanced discussion about migration, away from populist politics. Besides, the use of statistics, fact checking, and data visualization are becoming increasingly common in popular media.

Industry barons see a future in finding and harnessing water on asteroids for rocket fuel, which will allow astronauts and spacecrafts to stay in orbit for longer periods. Investors, including Richard Branson, China’s Tencent Holdings and the nation of Luxembourg, see a longer-term solution to replenishing materials such as iron and nickel as Earth’s natural resources are depleted. The most valuable known asteroid is estimated to be worth $15 quintillion, according to Asterank, a database owned by Planetary Resources, a company that aims to mine asteroids. That represents the world’s total gross domestic product (about $80 trillion) 192,283 times over. The U.S. government is interested too; Osiris-Rex, a NASA spacecraft, is on its way to a near-Earth asteroid to check out whether it will be viable for extracting water and minerals. We visualized the estimated value of known asteroids and their distance from Earth to show the massive potential profits at stake. Illustrations of NASA’s Osiris-Rex mission show how the spacecraft will retrieve an asteroid sample and return it to Earth, the next step in making asteroid mining a viable field.

The issue of air pollution from road traffic is especially topical at the moment. Emissions from road traffic have long been known to have toxic effects on humans but recent scandals involving some of the world’s largest automotive companies have greatly increased public awareness of the issue. The city of Glasgow has areas of poor air quality but little public engagement so there is a need to find more visually interesting ways to show air pollution data, and thereby increase the power of the message and drivers for change in the city. The model shows the results of an air pollution analysis prepared in collaboration with atmospheric scientists based in the city, which combines publicly available air monitoring data with a simple road dispersion model. The 3D visualisation of the data utilises similar geospatial analysis techniques to those commonly applied in terrain mapping. Air pollution maps were prepared in an open source Geographical Information System package (QGIS). These pollutant concentrations were then exported as vectors to Adobe Illustrator to be used in a laser cutting process with stacked poplar plywood layers representing pollution concentration. Pollutant concentrations are indicated by depth and tone, darker and deeper layers are higher in nitrogen dioxide. The red marker on the key indicates the current EU national limit of 40 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per metre cubed of air. An acrylic top layer has been added with the precise locations of Glasgow roads and motorways to allow recognition for the viewer. The effects of the major roads in the city like the M8 can be clearly seen, though some locations in the city centre are also high in nitrogen dioxide, exceeding national standards.

This project attempts to draw attention to sound features of the language by visually mapping phonetic qualities of the certain written text. A poem has been chosen to be visualised because of the fact that poetry is the literary form where the sound is highly relevant. In poetry, sound is an important source of poetic potency and is deliberately chosen and arranged to reinforce or to undercut meaning. The output suggests a new way of engaging with the poetic text - observing sound dynamics and patterns in visual forms. It shows a range of phonetic features and relations throughout the Korean lyric poem 'The night the owl cried' written by Joonkwan Lee (부흥이 우는 밤, 이준관 시인). 567 Korean letters ('Hangul'), of which 335 are consonants and 232 are vowels, have been turned into the symbols and arranged on the staves. The visualisation will let you explore the ways the sound works with the meaning. If you don't understand the Korean language, try and imagine what the meaning might be just by looking at the sounds but really closely.

For centuries, scientists wondered why egg shapes are so different from one bird to the next. Now, we think we’ve finally cracked the mystery. To start, we need to know what egg shapes are even possible. Luckily, hobbyists and natural history museums have been collecting and cataloging bird eggs for hundreds of years. Then, what kind of birds are linked with the different shapes? And finally, how might their special traits—from nesting habits to body size—change the shape of their eggs over evolutionary time?

1592	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1642-10	10万条挂号大数据显示：互联网也救不了看病难	DTimes	"Infographics are the key elements to shed light on the story, thus making Chinese hospital registration issue more clear and understandable to the audience. Hospital registration procedures has become a serious issue in China in recent years. It can be attributed to the over-demand of patients who prefer to go to hospitals with better quality. It is always said that ""seeing a doctor is like fighting a war, while registration in hospitals just is like the transport during Spring Festival"". Patients are always in line for 3 hours for 3-minute talks with doctors, with advanced internet reservation registration online platform which is designated to facilitate the procedures, the supply and demand between the hospitals/doctors and patients are still imbalanced. Many institutions have tried to make analyses on the issue, but most of those researches are too general and boring, so the readers cannot understand the whole picture in an intuitive way. Therefore, we made a new attempt by using collected big data and infographics to illustrate the phenomenon in detail and try to make some explanations. We chose a typical reservation registration online platform with comprehensive big data about patients and hospitals information. Then we collected and analyzed those data including the number of appointments, hospitals, geographic location, satisfaction rate etc. In the first infographic, we illustrated the whole picture of Chinese hospitals with and without online registration system. With the geographic data, audience may clearly see the imbalanced distribution of general Chinese hospitals and those support online reservation of registration: medical resources are extremely uneven in China. In Eastern China, the hospitals with online registration available are concentrated while in Western China those hospitals are hard to find. Usually one needs to describe the problem a paper, but it is more than clear to show on the infographic can be easily seen even by the children through the shining spots on the map. Infographics are used not only to illustrate difficult problems but also to make new findings. The second infographic shows a virtual line from Shanghai to inner cities in north-west part of China, along which those cities have higher online reservation rate compared with others. We had no idea about the line until we use tools to demonstrate data on the map. Data led us to make new findings which can be further studied in the short future. It is another charm of visualization and infographics. Besides maps, we also used other charts to illustrate the hospital registration in China. In the fourth infographic, we put the number of people using online registration of each province in China on a chart, which shows certain hospitals are over-crowded. This tells another key issue: a large number of people only choose the best hospitals of their province even though those hospitals are difficult to register. The red points, which represent the most popular hospital in each province, proved everything. In addition, we also used a simple bar graphic to show the differences between registration numbers in each province and patients’ satisfaction rate of hospitals. When the article was published, it spread quickly in mass media and quickly got attention of the insiders. The charm of the story does not lie in the words, but in the infographics which helped illustrate key issues through big Data."	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2016	Longlist;Data journalism

Even though there are a lot of places in the world possessing resources, more than 90% of the produced rare earth elements come from China. Mining and production are very harmful to the environment and create in the majority of cases a lot of radioactive and toxic waste. Despite the great value and the problematic production, only around 1% of all rare earth elements are recycled. The intention of the project was to create a series of infographic posters to give an overview about the topic, to explain the significance of rare earth elements and to call attention to one’s own recycling behavior.

It has the ability to identify the trends and patterns that result from forces, actions and reactions over time while also enabling predictions for future patterns. Denver, Colorado’s built environment has changed significantly from its beginnings in the late 1800’s, The original settlement area was situated near the Cherry Creek and South Platte confluence, which provided life-sustaining water sources. Over time, multiple forces such as natural flooding events, cultural shifts, economic swings and technological advances have physically manifested themselves on the surrounding area. The data collection, research, and analysis of this information is visually represented in the form of a simplified, mapped time line that depicts how these interactions may have affected each other. To better understand the relationship between elements, graphic representation of data has been interpreted, simplified and overlaid. Cherry Creek is depicted in a series of blue lines which indicate water levels and density relative to its average state of flow. Each blue line represents one-half inch of rainfall. As the density of the blue lines increase on the map, they become indicative of storm event intensity and potential for flooding.The length of each blue line shows water level spread, in feet, relative to normal water levels. Along with the flooding events time line, a historical events time line is superimposed to show significant points in time that were also influential. Dams and flood control techniques are graphically represented on the map, correlating to the year they were built as well as their thickness and strength. The combination of flooding and historical events’ affect on the built environment can be seen with the building density figure grounds. Figure grounds were derived from historic Sanborn and GIS maps. Flooding data was obtained from a multitude of sources, including scientifically recorded data as well as records of personal accounts of flooding. All sources utilized for this map were analyzed and interpreted to create a visual method for understanding the change over time in density, massing and the patterns of Denver’s buildings on each side of Cherry Creek within the study area.

1613	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2633-another-new-normal	Another New Normal	Caixin Media Company Limited	2016 was a stormy year for the real estate market. First of all, the sale amount of China's real estate reached 10.25 trillion yuan. Second, 22 cities in China took turns to restrict the purchase policy around the National Day. Both of these are historic events. We first collect the property price and the increase rate of 100 cities from 2011 to 2016 to present China's real estate market by a macro perspective. Then, central and regional real estate policies from 2009 to 2016 are collected to compare with the property price at that time. We find that most of policies were announced in the second half of rising phase (control) and the first half of the declining phase (stimulus). Curb the real estate bubble and prevent ups and downs were both important. The contributions of real estate to the local revenues can never be ignored. After that, we draw a house area map to show the big difference of property price among the cities. In the first tier cities, you may just buy a bathroom with 1 million yuan, while in the third tier cities you can buy a house with 200 square meters. Some mini data are also be used to describe China's real estate market like inventory, the price of land and bond issuance by real estate companies in 2016. We will still keep a watch on China’s house price which is concerned by millions of Chinese people.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	News & Current Affairs

1621	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2415-too-far-for-aid	Too Far for Aid	Shelley Hoover	20,000 immigrants in Illinois live further than 60 miles from the nearest Legal Aid Organization. Without proper legal aid, those without the financial means to pay for a private attorney are vulnerable to predatory legal aid. This puts them at risk for committing a felony by accidentally submitting incorrect paperwork and losing thousands of dollars in the process. This map series shows how the geographic divide between the Illinois' regions of Chicagoland and Downstate put an undue burden on immigrants and aid agencies alike. Using American Community Survey 5-year estimates of non-citizens by census tract and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) roster of accredited agencies, the maps show that tens of thousands of immigrants live further than a reasonable distance from aid. It also shows that many aid organizations potentially could serve thousands of immigrants, often times with only one or two attorneys on staff. Project methods: Software: maps were created with QGIS. Analysis: The American Community Survey data was analyzed by buffering distance from location of BIA organizations. The buffer zones were used to clip population statistics that fell within or outside the zone. Clipped regions calculated the total number of non-US citizen populations within the desired region. Shelley Hoover is a hobbyist map-maker who enjoys volunteering with a variety of non-profit organizations in her home city of Chicago.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Politics & Global

1635	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2487-a-modern-herbal	A Modern Herbal	7.4 Limited	For thousands of years, humans have used plants for medicinal purposes, and we still source drugs from plants today, including breakthrough treatments for cancer, malaria, neurodegenerative diseases and pain. As plants are immobile, they rely on specialized chemicals to protect them from stresses, such as being fed upon, changing seasons and UV radiation, and to communicate with other plants or with animals (e.g. for pollination). Plants produce more than 200 000 such compounds, and many have proved useful in medicine, either as the natural product or with slight alterations. Here we show prescription drugs that are approved by the European Medicines Agency or the US Food and Drugs Administration, and the plants from which they are derived arranged by relatedness. It illustrates that many of these compounds are limited to specific taxonomic groups (or even single species). For example, galantamine, used for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, is found exclusively in snowdrops and other closely related species. Over 95% of the world’s biodiversity has yet to be explored for medicines, so there is still great unrealised potential to harness nature to cure disease.

Each country is a point in space and each metric is a dimension (around 100 dimensions for the current map). Using dimensionality reduction (TSNE), clustering (DBSCAN) and topological data analysis (Kepler mapper), the points in high-dimensional space are projected and embedded in two dimensions. The result is a flat map that approximates the shape of data in high-dimensional space. A new world map with different borders and regions emerges.

With extinction looming, protection of endangered wild animals is urgent. However, regular text and data to warn people of this threat is often dull and thin. Therefore, I would like to consider these texts and data for visual information design, so that people can understand the urgency and importance of protecting endangered wildlife more quickly and accurately through intuitive visual forms. My design ""Endangered Species"" intends to effectively organize and summarize the information in a visual form, to show the people of Jiangsu Province what endangered wild animals are now facing in the living environment, as well as their habits and a variety of related data, in the hope by presenting the information beautifully, we can ""call on people to protect wild animals""."

These can be summarized in two points: promoting moving out of Cairo and buying a new apartment or villa in a new city or a nearby compound, and the use of almost the same visual symbols (i.e., 3-D models of the apartments over-looking a big green area, swimming pools, shopping centers etc.) that project what the future city will look like. The article follows a qualitative exploratory methodology. Data were collected through various methods including participant observations and visual analysis of Cairo billboards as an outdoor advertising tool to obtain a general overview of the publicly mediated city images/messages. The billboards on the sides of 6th October Bridge were used as a case study for this investigation as it is the longest bridge in Egypt. This analysis was conducted in November 2018 on a sample of 209 billboards.

Our project tracked every Indigenous death in custody for the last ten years. This unique, data-driven approach allowed us to identify that Indigenous deaths in custody are much more likely than non-Indigenous to involve failures of medical care, and breakdowns in procedure by responsible agencies. Almost half were not sentenced prisoners, but people who were on remand, in a lock-up, awaiting charges or involved in police pursuits. Information around deaths in custody is hard to find and often out of date. To fix this, our reporting team spent several months reading every available coronial report relating to Indigenous deaths in custody from 2008 onwards, as well as compiling and verifying information on deaths that had not yet gone to inquest. We assessed each of those cases across 37 data points. The same process was undertaken for non-Indigenous deaths in custody from 2010-2015 to allow us to undertake a comparative data analysis. In total we read 436 cases, of which 147 concerned an Indigenous person. Deaths Inside iis the most comprehensive publicly-available report on Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia, and is presented in an innovative visual format that allows exploration of the data without losing sight of the people behind the statistics. Publication of the database and associated stories prompted an immediate response from government, with Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion urging all states and territories to act on an important Indigenous custody notification system. Shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus commended the Guardian on the project and called on the government to act, saing ""the statistics that the Guardian have uncovered are appalling and completely unacceptable"". We have also been contacted by families of those who have died in custody, who say Deaths inside ensures that the death of their loved one will not be forgotten. Others have said it has also allowed them to connect with other families in similar circumstances for support and healing. Guardian Australia has been contacted by lawyers and academics saying the database will be an invaluable research tool for their own work, because existing government-run databases and monitoring services do not provide the same level of detail or functionality."

But then we get to numbers like 1,000; 10,000; 20,000. These numbers become increasingly difficult to conceptualize. But we can still grasp the general meaning of such numbers using visual models of large scale things we encounter often in our little realities.  The creator's main purpose of designing this “DeathTolls Experience” is to visualize the exact number of dead bodies in a particular event, so the user can face them all at once. Although it is based on facts and statistics, this is not a passive, unemotive experience. The death tolls are marked and the bodycount is visible.

1700	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2626-uber-and-cabs-around-the-clock	Uber and Cabs: Around The Clock	David Roberts	Preface: Why are using the same graphs that were invented in 1786? Science is necessarily methodical, and methodical can be slow. Like any slow process, the evolution and modernizing of the process is … even slower. And the world is evolving particularly fast where data is concerned. Data processing and storage is increasing exponentially, and science is falling behind. Today the truths we need are more complex and the arguments not so easily settled by a simple graph. My aims are to use the unrestrained nature of Art and its avenues of exploration to help convey some truths behind data. This hopefully frees the viewer to interpret the data in terms of its immediate impact but also aid a deeper objective contemplation and interpretation without an overpowering “message” preventing further understanding and hiding additional conclusions achieved by the viewer. This project shows the time-of-day that Uber and Yellow Cab pick-up in New York between April and September 2014, and how Uber is (or was) catching up. There are 4.5 million Uber pick-ups (green) and 82.4 million yellow cab pick-ups (yellow) between April and September 2014. Each is shown as a ring on the image, the radius scaling with the total pick-ups with the lightness of color scaling with the number of pick-ups, all shown on the 24-hour clock. The bars between the rings show how Uber pick-ups are approaching the previously dominant yellow cab pick-ups. The difference in the first and last 3-month periods are displayed as the bars between the two rings – the longer/lighter the bar the larger the difference. As Uber pick-ups are increasing and yellow-cabs decreasing in all cases both sets of bars approach each other. Pick-up locations are clearly a factor as shown in my other submission, however this image shows that the time-of-day is another strong factor. This image lends itself to a further understanding of how the balance of power might be shifting between the two means of transportation. The image was inspired by Kenneth Noland who used target shapes painted on a bare canvas background to lift the image and give maximum intensity to the image. Like Noland, these rings suggest the ever spinning action of a clock, and the change in color as the numbers shift from day to night and the inclusion of the grey-scale bars between the rings lift the rings above the flat plane and also aides the viewer in interpreting the data on two planes. The times between 6am and 9am show interesting behavior as the decrease in yellow cabs is at its strongest but the increase of Uber is not so strong which suggests, overall, that people are choosing other modes of transport for the summer. Walking and enjoying the sunshine. Uber data obtained via FOI request (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response) and Yellow Cab data available at https://nycopendata.socrata.com/.

1701	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2976-wondernet-physicality-of-networks	WonderNet - Physicality of Networks	Mauro Martino	What is the shape of networks? How do we experience network sculptures? Our goal with this project is to bring networks to life as physical objects, a testimony to their physical reality in spite of being an abstract mathematical construct. Networks are commonly visualized as node-link diagrams where nodes are generally represented as point-like objects and links as one-dimensional lines. We add physicality to the nodes and links to create a manifestation of a network in form of a three-dimensional object. If links and nodes have physical reality and occupy space, in traditional network models this results in multiple crossings between nodes and links, imposing a non-trivial algorithmic challenge. We developed a novel layout algorithm which uses physical forces to push conflicting nodes and links apart from each other. The network moves from Hyperuranion to become material and obey the laws of physics. We present different data sculptures: Spread of Fake News; Flavor Network, a correlation-based network of food ingredients based on the number of flavor compounds they share; Diseasome Network; Art Network, Museums and Galleries are the nodes, and connections between two institutions are formed when an artist exhibits at both; Mouse Brain Network.

However most people don't know about it. In a self initiated project we took the challenge of introducing the complex topic to a wider audience and making data comparable on several levels. We invented a radial deviation diagram, a hybrid of a bar chart and a pie chart.

Specifically, with The Sex Pistols’ June 4, 1976 show at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England. The concert now ranks as one of the most influential performances of all time, up there with Woodstock. But the audience, not the band, made the show famous. Around 30 or 40 people showed up (although thousands would later claim to have attended), and rumor has it that crowd included the guys who would go on to start bands like The Smiths, Joy Division, and the Buzzcocks. Rumors are enough for the designers at Dorothy, a studio that just released a data-viz poster called “Alternative Love Blueprint—A History of Alternative Music.” The poster ($43), like punk rock, begins with The Sex Pistols. A charted history of counter-culture rock music spills out from there, though not in any kind of linear, board game kind of way. “Taking that gig as a starting point, I tried to map out the bands who influenced each other in some way up to that point, from the early proto-punk and garage rockers, through CBGB’s era of punk,” says James Quail, the designer. “Then I mapped out where those scenes led through punk, post-punk, 2 tone & ska, hardcore, Riot Grrrl, Grunge, and so on.”	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Longlist;Arts, Entertainment & Culture

Would the resulting outcome help to prove that I had a legitimate concern or would it dispels my exaggerated worry?  I chose CCTV gala, the Chinese New Year celebration TV program which is an all-night stage show filled up with performances ranging from traditional songs and dances to pop music and comedies along with a heavy dose of state propaganda, as my experimental object to answer the question I had raised above.  We smashed videos from the Gala over the last 33 years from 1983 through 2015 and refactored frames into various timelines, thus revealing how red-dominated the Chinese mass media really is. Or is the Chinese mass media not as red-dominated as we assumed? Here is the spiraled timeline of 2004’s CCTV gala.  As people say you are what you eat, are we what we watch?

Sixth Tone decided to analyze and exemplify how these parents are doing the advertising and what kind of marriage they are looking for on behalf of their children. We collected a total of 874 anonymized advertisements, which include 618 women and 256 men. Our findings indicated more ads focused on the person’s looking, job, or housing ownership. Only 38% of the ads talked about personality and 11% mentioned their hobbies. We used the iconic umbrella shape in our visualization and presented for the first time among Chinese media a detailed overview of this “market”, in an attempt to dissect the psychology behind this unique Chinese social phenomenon.

People belonging to different age groups are seen hanging around in the square, most likely around the food stalls. The central courtyard, used for parking vehicles, is surrounded by a series of shops on the North, East and South. There are smaller food junctions towards the entrance, in the West, where the crowd is mainly seen. The market opens at 10 in the morning, but the crowd is seen only after 11 am. Students visit in the morning, while the officials visit in the noon. The actual business starts only in the evening. People start pouring in larger numbers as the sun hides below the horizon. The vendors have a great time selling goods till late at night and wrap up by 11pm of week days. Weekends are a boon to these vendors. The crowd on weekends is twice as much of that on weekdays and the market is open till 12 in the midnight. To understand the role of such public squares in a city, I observed both – tangible and intangible aspects of the place to represent them through maps. The below illustrated map is from the theme of mapping the movement of animals and birds The least considered and observed visitors are the animals and birds. This place has its own importance of birds and animals as localities take care of them. Crows are regular visitors and are fed by the shopkeepers every morning. The map illustrates the movement of Crows at its peak in the public square at early mornings when the human interference is minimum.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Unusual

In “How the Populist Right Is Redrawing the Map of Europe,” Bloomberg compiled a massive database that combined election figures from 22 countries and ideological classifications for 88 political parties going back decades. The project represents the most comprehensive assessment of populist parties on the right, which were identified with the help of several respected international academics. Merging these various datasets enabled Bloomberg to create an interactive map of unprecedented scope and detail, showing where 39 populist parties on the right have increased their overall influence across Europe. The visually captivating interactive also takes readers on a guided tour of several countries and regions to explore the demographic, electoral and economic issues unearthed in the data that help explain these parties' successes. A second interactive graphic further down presents an issue-based taxonomy that compares the policy positions of the various parties analyzed, alongside individual party profiles based on reporting from Bloomberg’s extensive network of European bureaus. These elements are supplemented by secondary graphics showing the correlation between the populist right’s vote share and rates of migration and unemployment; survey data about how open different countries are to populist right issues; and the rising influence of the populist right in European Parliament elections. The scope and detail of the data work and reporting involved, along with the ambition of its graphic presentation, we think set this project apart as an award-worthy example of data journalism at its finest.

I am interested in how I could use code to generate outcomes based on sound data. I went about this by mapping the frequency data from songs onto a sequential colour scale. I created a series on ‘The Velvet Underground and Nico’ album because I’ve always found this album inspiring and wanted to visually explore the experimental sounds and transitions in moods from each song. I decided to visualise it using a sequential colour scale with the low frequencies on the left (purple) side of the spectrum and the high frequencies on the right (green) side of the scale. I chose this colour scale because I feel as though the colours are dynamic and represent the emotions and ideas of the songs that I interpreted whilst I was listening to it (although I realise this is very subjective.) I also feel as though contextually, It links in with the psychedelic colours of the sixties which is when the songs were produced. It was interesting to visualise the Velvet Underground album using the same colour palette for all songs, as it allowed me to compare how long songs were and which parts of the album were more lively and energetic. Overall I found it really interesting to compare the patterns in the song and enjoyed exploring how my visual experience of the songs compared with listening to the song.

It’s how I understand and interact with information systems around me. It’s also how I learn new things. So after moving to a new house (in a new country) I realised I didn’t recognise half of the plants in my new garden nor did I know how or when to prune these unfamiliar plants. After researching these plants, I decided to create a visual guide to be able to reference in the future in order to maintain my garden. This visualisation shows the diverse floral patterns (inflorescences) and seasonal lifecycles within a sample of plants common to Northern Europe. This new visualisation method will help gardening professionals and enthusiasts design and maintain their gardens by providing a clear overview of flowering and pruning periods, average height, seasonal foliage, and floral characteristics. - Kate Snow Kate Snow Design Kate Snow Design combines a passion for complex information and concepts with a unique visual and typographic style to create insightful and engaging visual solutions.

1824	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3971-racial-disparities-in-illinois-traffic-stops	Racial Disparities In Illinois Traffic Stops	Mollie Pettit	In 2017, over two million traffic stops occurred in Illinois. Each time an Illinois resident was pulled over, the enforcement officer was required to record the details of the traffic stop, including: - The driver's race - The reason the driver was stopped - Whether or not the officer conducted a search - Whether or not contraband (illegal drugs, weapons, etc.) was found during the search - What action resulted (e.g. a citation/ticket, warning) The Illinois Traffic Stops data described above was analyzed in order to investigate whether systemic racial bias appears—and to what extent—in the Illinois traffic stops data. This site showcases the results of the analysis in a visual and explorable way, serving three main objectives. First, showcasing the results in a way that allows the ability to focus on specific law enforcement agencies gives those agencies the ability to easily explore their own data. Without this ability, law enforcement officers can’t know for certain what biases exist within their districts. In fact, research has shown that many of the biases found in this type of data are likely unconscious or unintentional, meaning agencies may not even realize they have a problem to address. By presenting this analysis in an easily digestible and explorable way, the law enforcement agencies of Illinois are able to educate themselves on what biases exist within their department, and use the insights to work together and make improvements for the good of the people they serve. Second, this project helped to enact change in Illinois Policy. The Illinois Traffic and Pedestrian Stop Statistical Study Act, which requires law enforcement officers to collect data during a traffic stop, was set to expire earlier this year. Without access to this data, law enforcement agencies would once again be in the dark on this matter. Thankfully, after the release of this site and a related report by the ACLU, a new bill continuing the collection was signed into law. Lastly, this site serves as an interactive resource for the public to learn about traffic stop law enforcement practices in the state of Illinois. Some key takeaways from this project are that, across Illinois: - When law enforcement officers search a car, they are typically no more likely to find contraband on a minority driver than a white driver. - Yet, Latinx and black drivers are searched at higher rates than white drivers. - Black drivers are also more likely to be subjected to dog sniff tests than white drivers. - In the agencies with statistically significant differences between white and Latinx dog sniff rates, dog sniffs are used in stops involving Latinx drivers at higher rates.

Marco Hernandez decided to put this to the test by posing a question: where in the world do workers get the most public holidays? By analysing data researched from government sources Hernandez discovered countries with diverse religious practices tend to give more national holidays to accommodate the cultural richness of their populations. Curiously, territories that are geographically smaller also seem to have a tendency to give more national holidays. The data shows how India’s diversity translates into a lot of regional holidays – far more than any other country. But the entire population doesn’t get to enjoy all 100 holidays together. In 2018 there will only be three nationwide rest days. Meanwhile, half the holidays celebrated in Hong Kong are secular while the rest are of a religious nature. There are 17 public holidays in 2018 which compares well with the UK’s nine nationwide, but pales when you consider statutory minimum holiday entitlement for full-time workers is 28 days in the UK compared to Hong Kong’s entry point of seven days. An interactive element uses the data from 20 countries for readers to compare. The countries cover a broad spectrum of governments that provide the most and least holidays and indicates how many are nationwide, regional or limited to particular sectors such as government employees.

This concept started when I was strolling through Amsterdam and Berlin in the same weekend. Both great places, each with their own attitude, architecture, neighbourhoods and vibes. But obviously they also have a lot in common. And I truly mean, a lot. With that in mind I made these 'new' city maps which you can use if you want to have a predictable city trip by using only 17 worldwide chain stores.

1852	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1587-galileo-galilei	Galileo Galilei	Nanjing University of Art	Galileo's Impact On Modern Science According to Stephen Hawking, Galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody else, and Albert Einstein called him the father of modern science. Galileo's astronomical discoveries and investigations into the Copernican theory have led to a lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) as the Galilean moons. Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the Galileo spacecraft, the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the proposed Galileo global satellite navigation system, the transformation between inertial systems in classical mechanics denoted Galilean transformation and the Gal (unit), sometimes known as the Galileo, which is a non-SI unit of acceleration. From my perspective, some respect should be shown to the great scientists. Science is the most desirable thing in the world. Today is September 15, 2016, Chinese traditional festival, the Mid-Autumn festival. China sent its second space laboratory, the Tiangong II, into orbit from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gobi desert on Thursday night. The infographic design which I have finished is to show respect to the Galileo Galilei, who is a great scientist I have been admiring. From my perspective, science should be attached great importance and be worshipped. When I was a teenager, I imaged that I could be a scientist one day. I was doing research and analyzing data everyday. Then something changed. Now, I am a designer. My respect to science has been shown by my project.

The nationwide fixed asset investment (excluding farmers) is 299 billion yuan, an increase of 5.8% from last year. The total retail sales of consumer goods amounted to 1952.1 billion yuan, with an 8.4% nominal increase over the same period last year. Chinese residents' disposable income per capita was 15,294 yuan, with an increase of 8.8% in nominal terms over the same period last year. It increased by 6.5% in addition to the price factor. In general, the operation of the national economy is in a reasonable range in the first half of the year, continuing the stable, steady, and progressive trend of development. However, we must also see that the current domestic and international economic situation is still complicated; global economic growth has slowed down, increasing the external instability and uncertainties. The insufficiency and imbalance in domestic development are still problematic, and the economy is facing new downward pressure.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Politics & Global

From the traditional sacrificial culture of the temple of heaven and the altar of agriculture, to the civilian culture of the Gulou and Qianmen area, to the royal culture of the central area and the inner city, the central axis of Beijing carries the complex and diversified culture that almost covers all levels of ancient Chinese society.

1863	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2806-how-to-record-your-band	How To Record Your Band	Carni Klirs	I created an explainer infographic about the recording process aimed at young musicians (age 13-18). I was a musician and played in bands throughout high school and college. The recording process always seemed really daunting, something that you had to pay a lot of money to do in a professional studio. As I had a DIY mentallity about a lot of things at the time, I spent considerable effort figuring out the process, through a combination of online tutorials and trial and error. I hit a lot of roadblocks and dead ends before I had a decent grasp of the process. I could have used a big picture overview, which covers how things plug into each other, and the general approach to recording a live band. So I designed an explainer infographic that I could have used when starting out. My only assumptions about the audience are that they are similar to where I was at 16: non-technical (some domain specific knowledge of music and instruments, but not of recording), but highly motivated. As there is a significant gender disparity in music, especially in the recording profession, I wanted the color, type, and illustration choices to be as “gender-neutral” as possible. I wanted to make the recording process seem as accessible to anyone, so kept the language simple and non-technical. The visual styling of the illustrations is meant to be a half-way point between technical drawings and cartoons. I wanted it be eye-catching and engaging, but accurate enough to be useful as visual references to the real life equipment the reader will encounter while trying to record.

Here we demonstrate the use of geofaceting to meet this challenge. Objective: Using data on young adult mortality in the 32 Mexican states from 1990 to 2015, we demonstrate how aligning small multiples for territorial units, often regions, according to their approximate geographical location – geofaceting – can be used to depict complex multi-dimensional phenomena. Methods: The idea is to align small-multiples for territorial units, often regions, according to approximate geographical location. We illustrate the technique using data on young adult mortality in the 32 Mexican states from 1990 to 2015. Results: Geofaceting reveals the macro-level spatial pattern while preserving the ﬂexibility of choosing any visualization techniques for the small multiples. Creating geofaceted visualizations gives all the advantages of standard plots in which one can adequately display multiple dimensions of a dataset. Contribution: Compared to other ways of small-multiples' arrangement, geofaceting improves the speed of regions' identification and exposes the broad spatial pattern.

For example, stories that are skewed to the right are usually unexpected events such as a celebrity death or a natural catastrophe. Stories with multiple peaks are normally longer in duration due to longer exposure in the media, such as the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation. Stories with broad national interest can have long tails or long ramp ups, such as the midterm elections. Finally, it is possible to visualize that news stories come and go with a certain rhythm throughout the year with the exception of a few gaps, notably during the summer school break and winter holidays.

In September 2018, StatsBomb - a leading football analytics company – open sourced an industry-standard dataset capturing event level details for all 64 matches from the World Cup. All in-game events like passes, crosses, shots, saves, tackles, dribbles, interceptions, etc. were supplemented with timestamps, location coordinates and other qualitative football specific metrics to map out each game with a high level of granularity. The primary motivation behind open-sourcing the data was to encourage the burgeoning football analytics community to come up with innovative new research in the field. This interactive dashboard – FIFA World Cup 2018 Match Explorer – contains a set of visualizations showcasing the finer details of each game which basic summary stats fail to uncover. The navigation guide walks the viewer through the main features of the dashboard. Here are a few general pointers about the visualization: 1. The Information Bar at the top can be clicked to access the Match Selection dropdown, Light/Dark theme switcher, match details and brief explanation of xG. 2. All individual plots contain mouse based click, hover and drag functionalities. Click and Drag to zoom into the views and double-click/click on the home button next to the visuals to reset to original. 3. Selecting a time range in the xG Chart (by click and drag) allows the viewer to filter the two charts below so that they show shots and team performance metrics for the selection game duration only. 4. The passing network maps show the team on the left attack from bottom to top, and the team on right from top to bottom. Clicking on player bubbles pops up details about that player’s performance in the Player Profile right above them. 5. Players’ passing angles and directions are illustrated through the radar plot, and are synced up directionally with the passing network map. Color of the wedges indicates the average pass length – Green to Red: Short to Long pass. 6. The size of the player bubbles and thickness, opacity of passing lines in the network maps are proportional to the number of passes a player, a pair of players were involved in. This entire project has been developed using Plotly’s Dash framework which enables programmers to build beautiful web-based interfaces in Python.

Scanning The Horizon: 12 Scenarios For 2021		"There are many ways to think about the future - but some are more productive than others. Horoscopes, prophecies and ancient dream interpretations, for instance, are not exactly useful: whereas horoscopes and dreams are too vague, prophecies are too doomsday-like to give a clear idea of what can be done to shape the future. This is what foresight is really about: choice, decision and action - and not, as is repeated time and again, predicting the future and getting it wrong. It is an intellectual and creative exercise designed to help decision-makers develop and make choices, challenge long-held beliefs and/ or orthodoxies, focus their resources and attention, and prevent and anticipate certain developments. This Chaillot Paper aims to alert decision-makers to potential developments with significant strategic impact while they can still prepare for, or even avoid them. This is done using two methods combined: horizon-scanning as well as single scenario-building. Taken together, they produce plausible events set in 2021 - with strategic ramifications well beyond that. All 12 scenarios in this Chaillot Paper reflect the expertise and imagination of the researchers who wrote them: some explore potential conflicts, while others look at disruptive political developments, or indeed at crises with significant ramifications. That said, all are designed in the hope of drawing attention to foreign and security policy aspects which are potentially overlooked, and all are extrapolated from ongoing and recent developments.

Considering the rapid pace of introducing new models in the Smartphone category, Nokia needed to train store staff (who are usually employed by independent stores) on the key selling features and benefits of Lumia, secure the staff's endorsement of the product while at the same time, ensure proper deployment and activation of their point-of-sale material/live devices in a timely and impactful manner. TNS' role was to ensure that Nokia's retail execution across these 14 markets were measured, monitored via: â€¢ a fast and timely method to ensure that relevant stakeholders can immediately action on the recommendation â€¢ a clear, succinct and straightforward manner as the audience were from the sales team who were not necessarily research-savvy and only wanted the core diagnostics of the findings for immediate implementation â€¢ a consistent approach across all levels of management – from Global, country heads and Field Force staff and retailers within each market â€¢ an impactful and engaging manner to help drive action from the results and continued support for Mystery Shopping program As an urgent response to this key action point, TNS proposed and executed a Digital Video reporting across all 14 markets under the global program. The deliverable was a video template that can be replicated and revised based on the results of the different markets covered by the global program. Apart from delivering results in a fast, concise, consistent and impactful manner, the Digital report also had functional benefits within Nokia's Business, namely: â€¢ Less man-hours – local team does not need to set up multiple meetings with their field teams and discuss the results, as they only needed to send the videos â€¢ Improving turn around – instead of waiting for local team availability local team can setup individual small meetings to discuss the video's results for immediate deployment. â€¢ Retention of figures – Local team mentioned it's now easier to recall scores / levels and insights taken from the report The Digital Video report follows the following format: â€¢ A 3.5 minute video that highlights key findings from the report â€¢ The video is uploaded and distributed through a secure Vimeo account â€¢ The video can be downloaded or streamed immediately from the link to enable quick access to the data reflected inside.

1981	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2207-india-s-nuclear-journey	India's Nuclear Journey	Atul Kumar, National Institute of Design	This infographic creates a narrative built out of qualitative data which maps India’s nuclear journey since colonial independence. The story outlines how a country marred by the pangs of separation in 1947 took pride in its own achievements and learnt from the losses. It shows the fall and the rise though political mistrust and conflicts, contrasted against key partnerships, agreements and mutually shared interests. It’s the story of India's journey from the status of a rogue nation up to its emergence as a world power armed with the full nuclear triad - that is, nuclear capable ICBMs, bombers and submarines. Most of the data for the narrative was collected through the secondary research based on media, journals, and archives. Since the nature of raw data was qualitative, it was structured and indexed, making it easier to scrutinise and visualise. Two timelines were chosen to provide a holistic story. One which deals with India's internal and national context, and another global timeline highlighting major events crucial to the world nuclear scenario. To help pick out these trends, each event in the chronological story was categorised as War, Peace, Establishment, Nuclear Test, Achievements, Tipping Point etc. Furthermore, to visualise India’s ambition, a metric was developed to quantify the qualitative data. Two types of events were marked: Events which were a Deterrent to India’s nuclear growth, or Encouragement which propelled India’s ambitions, acting as an impetus. A deterrent with global impact was given a score of -3, and a deterrent which was internal to India was given a score of -1. Similarly, encouragements were scored as +3 and +1. The fundamental structure of visualisation was inspired by the mushroom cloud formed by an atomic explosion. The semiotic connotation of nuclear fission where the nucleus is hit by accelerated particle is used to show the core events, which were the biggest impetus for India’s nuclear journey. The global timeline also utilises a ring structure to represent the atom.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Longlist;Science & Technology

Logo Trends Annual Report from 2003 to 2016 was thus analyzed with the data of “Logolounge.com”, and the criteria to classify the design characteristics of a logo were set based on Principles of form and Design, which enabled to classify and measure the logo trends. Moreover, we visualized the trend map of the measured logo design data, by combining Radviz and Circle parallel coordinate. Thereupon we figured out the most common design shape elements through Circle parallel coordinate while referring to the designed visualization, and discovered the logo trend changing pattern through interaction analysis of Radviz and Circle parallel coordinate. Research accordingly revealed that various Basic elements should be combined for a trendy logo. Moreover, when a specific logo trend turns into a new trend in a sequential order, trend nodes in a similar changing pattern are located in close proximity and the nodes born from the changes with various design shape elements are remote from each other. This research is thus expected to help better analyze the changing logo trends, and to serve as a helpful method to devise a pattern model to forecast the future logo trend.

1992	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2727-from-data-to-viz	From Data to Viz	Conor Healy, Yan Holtz	The ‘data-to-viz’ project aims to guide anyone to the most appropriate graphic representation for their given dataset. To do so, major chart types have been classified based on input data format. This classification has been translated in a visually appealing decision tree leading to a set of potentially appropriate visualizations. The decision tree comes in the form of a printed poster and is also embedded within a website that extends its usefulness (data-to-viz.com). The website includes: - an interactive decision tree, based on input data format - an extensive list of graph types with their description - reproducible R code for every chart - several data analysis examples based on real data - a gallery of common dataviz pitfalls: more than 40 caveats are described and possible workarounds are discussed. While many websites providing examples and descriptions of graph types already exist, this project is different in that it attempts to maximise user-usefulness. Besides providing a decision tool (the tree), it gives an immediately usable creation tool (associated R code), thus hopefully contributing to users engaging more easily and widely with data visualisation. Data to Viz is a project built by a data analyst (Yan Holtz) and a designer (Conor Healy). It is fully open source, with code available on Github. data-to-viz.com	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Shortlist;Longlist;Bronze;Winners;Visualization & Information Design
1993	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3351-video-motion-graphics-for-protocol-on-water-and-health	Video Motion Graphics for Protocol on Water and Health	Blossom	Nowadays, most Europeans take clean drinking water for granted. Yet, in the pan-European region alone, about 19 million people still do not have access to improved water sources and 67 million people lack access to improved sanitation facilities. About 100 million people do not have access to sanitation facilities at home, which makes them vulnerable to water-related diseases, such as cholera, bacillary dysentery, coli infections, viral hepatitis A and typhoid. Cleaner water and better sanitation could prevent up to 30 million cases of water-related disease each year in the region. The 1999 Protocol on Water and Health was negotiated with this in mind. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) asked Blossom to develop a video able to describe the Protocol on Water and Health, the first and only international agreement on water, sanitation and health. The aim of the protocol is to ensure that all people in the Pan European Region have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation through sustainable water management. To answer to the need of an explanatory video able to catch the attention of the public and being at the same time appealing and clear, Blossom used mixed media animation: motion graphics, footage and CEL animation. While motion graphics was used to present data and key messages, footage of water were used to create movement and to focus the user’s attention to water, the key element of the Protocol. CEL animation served to make situations and actions warmer and more realistic. The result is a 3-minute video, where Parties can immediately understand the reason behind the Protocol and the importance to establish national and local targets, for the well-being of the populations. https://www.blossoming.it/iba/blossom-for-unece/	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Longlist;Humanitarian

Yiran Yao, Din Li, Nanjing University of the Arts	Aircraft is one of the common transportation methods in modern society. Similar to the ground vehicles, aircraft is also subject to various rules of air traffic control, which is the regulation for airport operations. No matter the infrastructure of the airport or the construction of air traffic control, the airport strictly keeps the rules and order to ensure the safety of the aircraft. Most people have taken a plane, but few know the details about the airport operation. In this work, I mainly introduce the functions and resources that the airport provides for the aircraft. These informations are complicated, but in my finishing process, I found that they still have a certain order.so I want to introduce something about the airport operation and the structure of the airport with the method of infographic design. As a visual design upstart, information graphic design is one kind of graphic languages which has the deep connotation. It simplifies the lengthy language, removes redundancy information, and generates readable information. The infographics we have studied could diversify our experiences, broaden our view sights and show us the information that is not normally exposed. I've organized some simulated scenes, stats and line graphs into an airport infographic to share with you. Please enjoy it!	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2016	Longlist;Infographic
1999	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1844-america-s-most-common-christmas-related-injuries-in-charts	America’s most common Christmas-related injuries, in charts	Quartz	Every year, many Americans go to great lengths to get into the Christmas spirit. They carry trees into their homes, climb up onto various objects to hang strings of lights, and spend hours carefully wrapping gifts. But sometimes the Christmas spirit backfires. A man is poked in the eye by a rogue pine needle. A woman hanging decorations falls off of her desk and onto her face. Another woman slices her finger with scissors while wrapping gifts. Those aren’t hypotheticals; they’re real injuries documented by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The CPSC tracks emergency room visits at about 100 hospitals each year, and between 2011 and 2015 documented more than 1,700 Christmas-related injuries.

We used whole years for both the age and the war, so the brief Gulf War is given a full year, and World War II includes 1941. These are estimates. But the beginning of the conflict in Afghanistan in (late) 2001 means that anyone born in the past 13 years has never known an America that isn't at war.

2010	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1840-the-phylogenetic-roots-of-human-lethal-violence	The Phylogenetic Roots of Human Lethal Violence	Nature	"The psychological, sociological and evolutionary roots of conspecific violence in humans are still debated, despite attracting the attention of intellectuals for over two millennia. Conspecific means ""within their own species"". Here we propose a conceptual approach towards understanding these roots based on the assumption that aggression in mammals, including humans, has a significant phylogenetic component. By compiling sources of mortality from a comprehensive sample of mammals, we assessed the percentage of deaths due to conspecifics and, using phylogenetic comparative tools, predicted this value for humans. The proportion of human deaths phylogenetically predicted to be caused by interpersonal violence stood at 2%. This value was similar to the one phylogenetically inferred for the evolutionary ancestor of primates and apes, indicating that a certain level of lethal violence arises owing to our position within the phylogeny of mammals. It was also similar to the percentage seen in prehistoric bands and tribes, indicating that we were as lethally violent then as common mammalian evolutionary history would predict. However, the level of lethal violence has changed through human history and can be associated with changes in the socio-political organization of human populations. Our study provides a detailed phylogenetic and historical context against which to compare levels of lethal violence observed throughout our history."

In light of an estimated population growth of 2 million in the next decades, its infrastructure is in desperate need of improvements. These improvements call for new investments such as raising taxes and congestion charging.  CMAP (the regional planning office for Northeastern Illinois) approached CLEVER°FRANKE to create a micro-site to highlight the issues at hand. The site aims to educate and influence policy makers, and at the same time raise public awareness on the topic. The website combines interactive (3D) data visualisations, charts, time-lapse videos and aerial photography to tell a complete story of issues and proposed solutions.  The design concept revolves around ‘zooming’ in and out from macro to micro perspective on the region. The macro perspective provides insight into major trends and challenges for the region, whereas the micro perspective shows the impact of these developments to its inhabitants and their everyday lives.

The project is created in Unity and C#, using a comma separated data file to create objects in 3-dimensional space. This data file contains the following information about each station: o Name o GPS coordinates o Height above NORMAL o Depth (in ordnance datum) o Zone o Line o Amount of annual entries and exits All London Underground stations are arranged according to their GPS positions. The red bubbles in the scene resemble the station's entries, the blue represent the station underground. By mapping the position of the Z axis of each object to the depth and height values in the data file, one receives a 3-dimensional map giving an overview of the entire vertical landscape of the London subway system throughout the whole London area. Shown are each station's entry above normal and the depth of the station itself below its entry. The transparent plane separating the red from the blue bubbles represents above-normal for the station's entries. For the station's depths however, the plane represents the stations entry point. This way, the actual depth below the ground is shown rather than relating to its position to above-normal. Displayed in the left corner is the station's name and the exact numbers of the station's depth and height, as well as to bars that visualise both values in relation to each other. One can select important stations by name on the menu above, as well as skip through all stations alphabetically or jump to random stations. It is possible to move around with the arrow keys, zoom in our out with the mouse wheel or the W/S keys as well as look around in the entire scene and inspect everything below the plane with the mouse holding the right mouse button. To add more context, the color of the London Underground lines can be switched on, as well as a visualisation of the busyness of each station (according to annual entries and exits).

2029	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3005-ecole-polytechnique-federale-de-lausanne-epfl	École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)	EPFL	Academic affinities are one of the most fundamental hidden dynamics that drive scientific development. Some affinities are actual, and consequently can be measured through classical academic metrics such as co-authoring. Other affinities are potential, and therefore do not have visible traces in information systems; for instance, some peers may share scientific interests without actually knowing it. This visualization is a map of affinities for scientific collectives. The case study involves the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering of EPFL, which consists of three institutes, seventy laboratories, and around one thousand employees. The actual affinities are modeled using the data available from the academic systems reporting publications, teaching, and advising, whereas the potential affinities are addressed through text mining of the documents registered in the information system. The major challenge for designing such a map is to represent the multi-dimensionality and multi-scale nature of the information. The affinities are not limited to the computation of heterogeneous sources of information, they also apply at different scales. Therefore, the map shows local affinities inside a given laboratory, as well as global affinities among laboratories. The visualization presents a graphical grammar to represent affinities. This graphical system is actualized in several embodiments, among which a large-scale carpet of 250 square meters, and an interactive online system in which the map can be parameterized. In both cases, we discuss how the actualization influences the representation of data, in particular the way key questions could be appropriately addressed considering three target audiences: the insights gained by the management and the relative decisions, the understanding of the researchers own positioning in the academic collective that might reveal opportunities for new synergies, and eventually the interpretation of the structure from an external standpoint that suggesting the relevance of the tool for communication.

2040	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/404-bp-technology-experience	BP Technology Experience	MPC	Creative studio MPC and global brand agency Jack Morton Worldwide, created a major experience to bring to life BP's key capabilities for 2,500 global VIPs, stakeholders and employees. The BP Technology Experience took place at the Linbury Theatre, the Royal Opera House, during July and August 2012. BP's brief was to create a once in a lifetime experience with technology at its core, telling the story of –More Discovery, More Recovery, More Efficiency' and one which pushed the boundaries of corporate experiences. MPC worked with Jack Morton, to create a fully immersive and sensory experience that was not only technologically advanced, but also borrowed from theatrical traditions both physical and emotional. The scale of the project was huge and a large team was needed to pull off the installation, that encompassed 30 mins of animated content over 5 environments, 3 areas of multiple projection set-ups, using 33 projectors. Area 1: A showcase of BP's technology for oil discovery – the set was designed to visually create a slice of the earth's crust and show different surveying techniques used both on land and under the sea. A kinetic floor added extra layer of depth to this experience. Area 2: A journey through an interconnected data world – a fully immersive environment with visual content on the walls, floor and ceiling. The idea was that the audience should feel like they were travelling through this data world in a glass elevator. Area 3: The theatrical finale – the content for this area was looking at the future developments in technology and the drive for better efficiency in oil recovery. The projection mapping had to work with different parts of the set that were moving around and being flown in and out. MPC collaborated with Jack Morton on both the creative ideas and providing visual content for all areas of the installation. The sheer amount of data and information we needed to generate content for was of course a challenge. How do you make an experience truly epic, yet immersive and keep it creative and beautiful at the same time? Each area was sketched and drafted out using an animatic, while the design process begun. Design played a key role and a lot of attention was given to the detail – the visualisations, look and feel of each area, infographics and typeface. The infographics were a key element in connecting all the visuals - they worked to draw attention to important narrative points, while maintaining a strong and creative aesthetic. MPC's elegant yet dynamic 3D and 2D animation brought all this together. Scenes varied from time-lapsed shot elements, to photo-real 3D scenes. Many sequences were very graphic, utilising wire frame environments, visualisations and cross-sections. All were linked seamlessly through crafted animated transitions. The project was unique in that it brought together a lot of information in an original narrative, to communicate to a corporate audience. Essentially the medium became part of the message - a world leading technological story, told through cutting edge technology and VFX.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Infographic

The human body is increasingly encountered as a data body. Movements, emotions and states are measured, quantified and transformed into data. At the same time this data is the mirror in which the body is reflected and is also its point of orientation. While a growing number of people enjoy using ‘life tracking’ to monitor and track their bodies and share on social media, companies offer online analyses of emotional states for therapy and advertising purposes. If until recently the human being was the analogue gap in the digital world, this gap is being rapidly closed with our enthusiastic help.

With it help stories hidden in figures could be told in a clear and consistent way. It saves teller’s and an audience’s time, underlines significant parts of a message, helps to shape a narrative. An image becomes an integral part of the story. And the more important is this part, the more accurate and precise it should be. So, how this precision and accuracy may be reached? Diagrammm project offers the answer to this question. Diagrammm has been developed as an online source of the data visualization grammar. It could be treated as a handbook of how to design various types of visualizations in an appropriate and adequate manner. It is about the basic, fundamental principles of good information graphics. Very often creative and revolutionary visualizations, however, break some of these fundamentals. And, as a result, even ingenious graphics could lead to misunderstanding and confusion. That is why it is so important that even the most innovative visualizations are backed by the strict following of the visualization grammar postulates. Otherwise, an attractive design will not bring more understanding and clarity to a told story. Equally, the same weaknesses refer to the simplest types of visualizations. Diagrammm has offered organized, structured, and detailed manuals of how to omit the above-mentioned weaknesses and pitfalls, and make a final visual product consistent, reliable, and accurate. Moreover, Diagrammm provides the list of references, books and other supplementary materials that were used as the sources of the information. Following the list users will be able to dive deeper into the topics concerned with specific types of visualizations. Diagrammm will be useful for broad audiences - both experienced data visualization users and beginners. The former will be able to improve and polish their graphics and the latter will know from the very beginning how to do visualizations in a right way. Diagrammm website is completely created and managed by Roman Sverdan who is an information designer from Lviv, Ukraine. The Project is an author's pet project that has been grown up step by step during last year. So far, the website contains seventeen charts and there are more than a hundred to come. Every single chart on the website is created by the author and published on the website in the SVG format that makes it easy to use on any type of screen. And it doesn't matter what is the resolution of your screen - the charts always look beautiful. If we speak the same data visualization language, let’s improve our grammar basics.

2102	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3982-water-scarcity-clock	Water Scarcity Clock	World Data Lab	The entrant has supplied multiple files for this work [1] [2]  The Water Scarcity Clock is an interactive data visualization webtool created to raise awareness about the reality of water as a finite resource. The tool is aimed at the general public and policy-makers, designed to simplify the complex subject of water scarcity in a compelling way. The tool was created by the World Data Lab in partnership with the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and commissioned by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany). The Water Scarcity Clock visualizes the number of people living in water scarce areas around the world from 1980 to 2030. There are two interactive sections that help tell this story. In the first section, users are greeted with a spinning globe behind a live-ticking headline number. Under the globe is an interactive timeline. The headline number counts the number of people that are affected by water scarcity. The timeline allows users to explore data for different years. The second major section of the tool is an interactive map section. Here, water availability numbers are dynamically present the percentage of local populations living in areas within different thresholds of scarcity. The thresholds are based on the commonly used Falkenmark Index which measures the amount of renewable fresh water available for every person each year. We use 3 thresholds, absolute water scarcity (less than 500m³ of water), water scarcity (500-1000m³ of water) and water stress (1000-1700m³ of water). All three are visually represented on the map itself and within the “water card” view for each country. The user can choose between three different lenses to view the world map. Each lens reveals an important angle on water scarcity. The three lenses are overall water availability, water availability during the driest month, and population density. Both water availability maps break geographies into grids. Breaking down the world map into grids and allowing users to zoom into 50km x 50km geographic areas helps highlights the regional and local aspect to water scarcity. Although a country overall may not be water scarce, there can be areas within the country where people are struggling with less than 500m³ water available in a year. The inverse can also be true. Some countries will appear water scarce while most of the population may live close to an accessible water source. The zoom feature and color doing showcases these nuances well. The “water availability during the driest month” map highlights an important fact that a sizeable percentage of world’s population suffers from absolute water scarcity for at least one month of the year, emphasizing that water scarcity is a global issue. For each country there is a corresponding “water card” popup with greater detail. Each water card contains the total population, the driest month for that country, the number of people in that country living in water scarcity, and the number of people living in different thresholds of water scarcity.

While we've always had a fear of missing out, today it's exploding with the onset of real-time, location-based and social media tools. We're exposed more than ever before to what others are doing, and we're filled with a gnawing uncertainty about whether we've made the right choiceâ€”not just in a given moment but in stages of our lives as well. Created as a companion to our March 2012 JWTIntelligence report and included in a 2012 SXSW Interactive presentation, “Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)” uses an up-tempo soundtrack, clean and bold animations, and engaging visual transitions to capture and keep the viewer's attention from one piece of information to the next. Set against a light grey backdrop, the vibrant colors of the characters pop as they serve to highlight and enact the text that appears on the screen; each transition moves the content along at a seamless and snappy pace, without jarring or losing the viewer along the way; and the soundtrack complements and helps set the tone. Overall, as the different pieces come together, each aspect works harmoniously to convey the uneasy and sometimes all-consuming feeling that you're missing out, all in an entertaining and charming manner.

BSports then simulated each match of the tournament over 100,000 times to create a highly probable projection for every potential outcome of the World Cup. The results determined BSports’ projections for each team’s odds of beating any other team as well as their final finish within the tournament. Using this data, Bloomberg Visual Data created a data visualization product that showcases these projections. Group play matches are represented by stacked bar charts that show the likelihood of winning or tying, while the knockout stage are presented as brackets, with the ability to highlight any team's potential path to victory. Using BSports’ projections as a starting point, users may pick the outcome of each match to create and share their own predictions. The predictions tool then applies BSports’ odds to each match and calculates the winner of the Cup as well as that team’s probability of winning. The World Cup results page shows the tournament’s current standings. On match pages, projected outcomes and scores are presented prior to game play. Following a match these projections are replaced with the actual outcomes and each team’s odds of winning the Cup are recalculated. Detailed information on any given pairing of teams can be found as well as a schedule of every match.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2014	Shortlist;Longlist;Interactive Visualization

Plastic is in almost everything. Plastic production exceeds 300 million tonnes annually and if current trends continue, another 33 billion tonnes will have accumulated around the planet by 2050. Over two-thirds of plastic consumption comes in the form of packaging such as containers and bags, and building products like plastic pipes and vinyl siding. Massive amounts of electronic and electrical products are made out of plastic. While we may not be aware of it, we also wear a lot of plastic. For example, the soles of shoes are often made of polyurethane or similar materials. One way or another all these items will eventually create plastic waste.

Rather than assigning a specific time and place for people to interact, Visualizing Knowledge 2018 devised a system that encouraged connections through the features of the conference’s identity. To achieve that, the conference organizing team developed two visual elements: a data-driven shape that revealed each participant’s interest in core aspects of the information design process based on a spider diagram, and a wordmark that could be extended with the topics addressed at the conference. These elements were used on conference material – from badges to introduction slides – for both the attendees and the speakers. For one, this approach made it possible for attendees to link their interests with the speakers’ profiles and the topic of their talks before and during the conference. For another, these nonintrusive elements allowed for an individual pace to human interactions in a large gathering of people.

S&P Global Platts has created the first ever interactive Periodic Table of Oil. It unravels the complexity of the $1.7 trillion oil market that has bamboozled energy journalists, traders and governments. Until now. With hundreds of different grades making up the world’s daily 100 million barrel diet of crude, traders need to know vital information about each barrel’s density, sulfur content and production levels, as well as where it’s produced and who buys it. Using the Periodic Table as inspiration, Platts found an innovative way to order this information. Like the Table of Elements, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, the crudes are ordered from lightest to heaviest. The graphic also allows users to see which crude oil grades are traded in specific regions in addition to their relevant price benchmarks. It shows, for example, how OPEC, through its alliance with Russia, may have lost market share but gained control of the key grades wanted by refiners. It allows readers to slice and dice the information depending on their market's needs. But don’t just take our word for it. Oil market participants are raving about it. A director at Clearview Energy Partners said the table “deserves a Nobel prize for the visual presentation of quantitative data.” While a director of Petromatrix daily research note tweeted: “Very cool.

NBC News	Dear Judges: Former special counsel Robert Mueller made it clear after releasing his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that he wouldn't have more to say on the topic beyond the 400-plus pages in the report his team delivered to the Attorney General. He went so far as to say at a press conference that he would not provide any additional information if called before Congress.  So when he went before two judicial subcommittees in July, it wasn't a question of whether he could deflect questions from politicians, but how often. Anticipating this would be one of the storylines from the event, the NBC News data graphics team built a Google Sheets-powered backend that provided data to a graphic we would use to track Mueller’s deflections.  Through seven hours of testimony, we tracked exactly when and what kind of deflection Mueller made. The graphic was built with d3 and custom code that polled every ten seconds to update itself with the latest from a JSON file with the data. This provided the reader with a visual guide to the almost 200 times Mueller dodged, deflected, and diverted questioners back to his report.

The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald	Sexual violence in Australia is pervasive but rarely prosecuted, much less punished. Invisible Crime is an attempt to give a count to these crimes, a texture to the experiences of those who survive them and a data-driven analysis of the systems that too often fail to deliver justice in their wake. A mix of data visualisation, multimedia and months of shoe-leather reporting, the feature attempts to ground its storytelling in hard numbers while never losing sight of the women and men they represent.

Yet with the rise of right wing and white supremacy in the US recently, it seems as if the small screens are coming together, bringing back the big screen, and forming a wave of extreme force that starts to tear our society apart.

It is the world’s first fully digital natural resources inventory, drawing on extensive open data about the state’s land, water, vegetation, geological and energy resources. Based on over 100 datasets relating to 19 vital resources, the Inventory displays over 9000 unique metrics, including related data and supporting information. The Inventory is structured around major resource themes, allowing users to explore topical issues at a whole of state level. Users can drill down to local government area, watershed or geological basin reserve level to gain a local perspective of resource availability. The application was designed as an entry point for investors, journalists, students, industry groups and government employees to explore natural resources and their use. The Inventory was designed and developed by Truii (including hundreds of hours of data wrangling) for the Queensland Government Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy. Data will continue to be updated into the future and improvements will be made according to user needs.

2178	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1705-dress-for-our-time	Dress For Our Time	Holition	Dress For Our Time, by award-winning artist and designer Helen Storey MBE RDI (London College of Fashion, UAL Centre for Sustainable Fashion) and creative agency Holition is a unique installation that brings statistics and fashion together to explore one of the world’s most pressing issues. Using innovative technology, the latest data and Helen’s unique voice in fashion, Dress For Our Time will delves into the complex matter of human displacement in a pioneering endeavour to change the social narrative of this complex topic. The dress itself is a decommissioned refugee tent which once housed a refugee family in Jordan and was gifted to the project by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In giving the tent a meaningful reincarnation as a public installation, Dress For Our Time transcends both data and fashion by humanising the numbers to tell a bigger story. The UNHCR has logged a record 65.3 million people currently displaced worldwide and 21.3 million refugees*. Dress For Our Time uses the very latest data, representing one year’s worth of UNHCR statistics collected by its Field Information and Coordination Section. This information was utilised to visualise the refugee crisis through a striking animation that will be projected onto the dress itself using bespoke data visualisation developed by Holition. The animation is formed of points of light, each representing one hundred human lives and creatively illustrates the journey each one takes in search of a better life. The lights flow from six points, depicting the continents where the refugees have moved from, before populating the countries in which they find shelter. The image that emerges is not a world map of countries but a never seen before map of human migration. Helen Storey, Professor of Fashion and Science at London College of Fashion, UAL said “Worldwide, one in every 113 people on the planet is now either a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking shelter - but numbers means nothing, if they don’t affect your own heart. This project uses the power of fashion to help us connect to the previously unimaginable and asks how each and every one of us can remain a humanitarian in such a time of colossal and irreversible change”. Jonathan Chippindale, CEO Holition commented “Dress for Our Time harnesses the appeal of fashion with the power of data-visualisation to communicate complex issues and stimulate debate about society and the effect of migration”. On Thursday 17 August-4th September, Dress For Our Time was invited to be exhibited in the Science Museum as part of their Our Lives In Data exhibition. The reception from media and visitors was exceptional and the data visualisation piece was praised for uniqueness and emotive interpretation of such a complex and sensitive topic.

As we all know, terrorist organizations are anti-social, anti-state, focusing on the struggle, killing innocent people. These inhumane acts of terror are heinous which are hated by people. Therefore, terrorist organizations are undoubtedly one of the greatest threats in the 21st century. They not only pose a great threat to personal safety, but also they have a major impact on the international community. As a military peace investigator, this time I use ""IS"" as the theme, making an in-depth investigation of the history of years of IS's development, and making a comprehensive chart of it. I use the timeline as the main line in the entire chart, developing a number of sub- tables from the beginning of IS until May 2015. In its content, the chart shows the changes in ""IS"" over time, including regional changes in ""IS"", ""IS"" funding sources and expansion and reduction.The whole world has taken actions and the various preventive measures against “IS”, which include crash events, terrorist attacks in Paris, terrorist attacks in Brussels and so on. The purpose of this topic is to hope that people can have a certain understanding of terrorist organizations, while calling on countries to unite together to end the brutal acts of terrorist organizations.

(An Extremely Detailed Map Of The 2018 Brazilian Elections)	Estadão	For the 2018 Brazilian general elections, our team developed a highly detailed results map, segmenting the electoral results by ballot location. This may seem trivial in countries where the state of open-data policies is more advanced, but the Brazilian electoral authorities don’t provide the geographic coordinates of most voting sections, only their addresses – and even this basic data is often too dirty to be used easily. To overcome this, we spent months cleaning the database and geocoding around 52,000 locations. After that, which would already amount for an never-seen-before level of detail by itself, we decided to add another layer to our analysis. Most people in the country vote in the ballot closer to where they live, a policy that is stimulated by the electoral registration officers. Due to that, we used the voronoi algorithm to approximate the ‘area of influence’ of each point – that is, we drew polygons upon the map, each one enclosing all the people who vote in a given place. Having computed those areas, we were able to use census tracts data to approximate the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the people that voted in any place of the country.

2198	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/285-hunger-strikes	Hunger Strikes	Ahmad Barclay, Hani Asfour, Nader Tfayli, and Joumana Al Jabri	In 2012, over 2,400 Palestinian Prisoners mounted a hunger strike against the Israeli military for detention without trial. –Hunger Strikes' was created as one Palestinian administrative detainee, Khader Adnan, concluded the second month of a 66-day total voluntary fast. Adnan's story quickly captured Arab public interest, but coverage by the Western press was comparably limited and often presented in the narrow context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Visualizing Palestine (VP) team wanted to bring the attention of the world to what a hunger striker goes through in pursuit of justice and dignity. The hunger strike is both an extreme feat of human physical and mental endurance and an abiding tool of non-violent political protest used all over the world throughout history. The VP research team turned to medical journals featuring studies of imprisoned and hospitalized hunger strikers to learn more about what a hunger strike means for the body. Based on documented medical evidence, they were able to make sense of the deteriorating physical and mental health of hunger strikers with each passing day and week. In parallel, they collected wide-ranging stories of other prominent hunger strikes throughout history, from Mahatma Ghandi to Bobby Sands. The designers of the infographic adopted a timeline format, allowing for the integration of personal and historical perspectives. Thus, the timeline shows the story of the health sacrifices and suffering of an individual striker, while also speaking to the universal quality of hunger strikes by recalling prominent past episodes from around the world. The concluding quote, a statement from the 1989 mass hunger strike in Tiananmen Square, China, aimed to frame the actions of hunger strikers in their own words. While a hunger strike can be portrayed as simply an extreme or misguided act of an individual, it should be understood in a much broader context of social struggle. –Hunger Strikes' was released on the day Khader Adnan ended his total voluntary fast. Visualizing Palestine relied on social media and word-of-mouth to share its debut work, since the fledgling collective had not yet established a solid platform or following. Even so, the response to the infographic was overwhelming; in the span of the first 24 hours, –Hunger Strikes' had been seen by 15,000 people.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Infographic

On August 22, 2017, the mercury soared, measuring record temperatures of 36.6°C, making it the hottest day since 1884. This became the catalyst for the South China Morning Post’s infographic designer, Pablo Robles, to begin researching Hong Kong’s changing temperature patterns in his quest to discover if there was a correlation between the weather and energy consumption. Over the last four decades, he discovered the weather in Hong Kong has not only become hotter overall, but the territory also experiences more extremes of hot and cold days every year. Robles manually analysed 133 years of monthly data registered and compiled by the Hong Kong Observatory. In order to visually represent this data Robles created a graphic comparing extreme temperatures to energy consumption. Robles found the Hong Kong Environment Bureau had 47 years of energy consumption data. Gathering this information indicated parallel behavior between energy consumption and extremely hot months; in a city where air conditioning represents 34% of annual energy consumption. A vertical, interactive path tracks the average temperature and energy consumption for each month. Lines represents months of the year with their thickness indicating the amount of energy consumed. The colour shows the average temperature with ranges between 12°C and 33°C. Very hot and very cold days were indicated along with heat waves, cold fronts and other important events from the past 50 years. The hottest day of 1970 was compared to the hottest day of 2017, showing that energy consumption has increased more than tenfold. This project was published on May 23, 2018, during a heat wave of ten consecutive days over 33°C and record highs of 38.6°C around the city. The print and digital versions of this graphic visualise the same data in different ways with each utilising the unique advantages to the particular medium.

CLS researchers analysed information from more than 12,000 11-year-olds born across the UK in 2000-01. They considered different factors that could influence children’s mental health and wellbeing. Few factors affected mental illness and wellbeing in the same way, suggesting that these aspects are driven by different things.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Science & Technology
2209	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/518-major-league-baseball-franchise-valuations	Major League Baseball Franchise Valuations	Bloomberg Graphics	When the Los Angeles Dodgers sold for over $2 billion last year, the purchase price — which was 54 percent more than prevailing estimates — didn’t just elevate the fortunes of the team’s owners. It raised the valuations of every franchise in Major League Baseball. In an effort to bring transparency to such a huge industry, Bloomberg News spent nine months compiling and analyzing the numbers behind the business, and determined that MLB’s 30 teams are worth about 35 percent more on average than previously thought. The datasets examined revenue from tickets sales, concessions, sponsorships and broadcast rights, as well as interests in TV channels, radio stations and real estate. The final form became a polar area diagram. Clicking on any team shows their info and hovering over any other team adds comparison. The viewer can sort the order of the teams by total value, league, division and number of wins.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2014	Longlist;Interactive Visualization

And now that these hundreds of millions of people from all over the world listen to their songs on the same platform, a question arises: what on earth are they listening to? The Top 50 charts for these 60 countries are generated by counting the amount of streams per song and connecting this to the country in which it is played. At the same time, for every track on their platform, Spotify provides data for thirteen audio features. Of which the most independent measures are: Danceability, Valence and Tempo. By bringing the scores for each feature together for each country, we might be able to identify their musical DNA.

Since 1886, there have been more than 600 deaths in the park: from falls, drownings, dehydration and heat stroke, hypothermia and other causes.  We built the “Fatal falls at the Grand Canyon” project to give readers context that goes beyond the headline-grabbing spate of deaths in and around the national park. We used photos, 3d imagery of the Grand Canyon, and modern-day cartography to tell the story of the people who have died and where they died. Based on a dataset built from a book on Grand Canyon deaths, geocoded by hand, we mapped deaths in and near the park all the way back to 1886.To find the coordinates, we went one by one, figuring out the location based on descriptions in the book, ""Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon,” by Michael P.

The bars associated with wins extend outward while losses extend inward. The length and the width of each bar represent the run differential. Winning and losing streaks are represented by the outer ring. Winning streaks extend outward while losing streaks extend inward. The width of the line and the further it extends represents the length of the streak. For more information, a reader can hover over this chart or select a point or multiple points to highlight the inner ring. In both charts, team colors will help differentiate between wins and losses.

The top part is an animated track map that visualized all the typhoons from 1949 to 2016. The yellow lines (474 tracks) show the ones that landed in China. The bar chart below the map shows the number of typhoons in every year. Then we summarized how frequently and badly we suffered from typhoons. The first part is about the super typhoons whose names have been removed from the namelist. Those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms. We visualized those typhoons respectively. The different width and color of lines resperent the different level of TCs. And the map clearly shows landing track of those super typhoons. The Second part is about which area has been hit most. When we calculated the number of typhoons that landed in each provinces, Guangdong and Hainan suffered the most; but when the user click on the button above the chart, they will find out Taiwan had most super typhoons landed in its land. We also collected the damage data from yearbooks, which was visualized in a bar chart, including the number of victims, the number of deaths, and economic losses, so that we can further observe the impact of typhoons on people.

In a World where sexual abuse and workplace harassment are too common, this online dialogue has become a powerful international movement that shed a light on the magnitude of the problem. We explored themes and global reach of about two hundred thousand tweets containing or related to the hashtag #MeToo.

Although considered a pest, for its ability to spread and grow anywhere, the common dandelion is a beautiful and complex flower which has been used in popular culture to symbolise: endurance, growth, and the possibility of change. #MeToo marks a time when Twitter and other social media have become a platform to unfilter and reshape cultural biases. Our project is intended as an archive – we wanted to capture the momentum (from Latin -mentum) the MeToo Movement gained and we wished to celebrate the bravery of all the people who spoke up, sharing their personal and difficult experiences to provide the possibility for change. “MeToomentum” was exhibited in London as part of the Data Obscura exhibition – curated by Signal Noise, and part of The Economist’s Open Future initiative.

University of the arts London, central saint martins	As someone who has seen the damage drug abuse does to people I was inspired to create this infographic with the main purpose of displaying clarity and understanding. We often hear the names of these drugs but do we often get to see what they look like? What is it that we should be cautious of? I feel like statistics regarding substance abuse are more understandable when people can see what the actual cause is. Its aim is to educate, so I believe that having a visual representation of the cause is vital. The reality is that what can be perceived as harmless elements can and has been deadly. Only a few of the drugs listed are illegal substances. In this case it’s beneficial to the reader if they can see what it is that could be dangerous to know to look out for it, if need be. I purposely made it clear to read by making the information direct and simple. It’s in order from the biggest amount of deaths to the least with an image, name of the drug and number of deaths. It’s designed to represent the number of drug-related deaths where selected substances were mentioned on the death certificate, from deaths registered in England and Wales in 2016.

There’s the classical physics you learned about in high school: It can explain how much force it takes to slide a box across the floor, how heat transfers from one object to another, or how light bends through a prism. Then there are more modern branches, such as particle physics, which seeks to understand the fundamental building blocks of the universe. And physicists are always on the lookout for new branches yet to be discovered (they need something to account for mysteries like dark energy). All of these topics fall under the umbrella of “physics,” and it’s a lot to keep track of. So here’s some help. In this video, physicist Dominic Walliman explains how all the subdisciplines of physics are related in one animated “map” of the science.

For example, how would you assess the typical look and topology of beaches around the world in Google Maps? Biologists experience this challenge when studying the 3D structure of the genome. The structure is visualized as a heatmap matrix of 3 by 3 million rows and columns and contains several thousand small patterns that are of interest to the analyst. HiPiler is a web-based tool that addresses this challenge by separating hundreds to thousands of small regions of interest from the original matrix and letting the analyst interactively explore thumbnails of these separated regions, called snippets. Snippets can be arranged, aggregated, and compared manually or automatically along computationally-derived data attributes. Snippets can be laid out in one or two dimensions using data attributes such as size or noisiness or derived attributes like confidence scores from the algorithm that identified the patterns in the first place. To scale to thousands of snippets the user can manually or automatically aggregate snippets into piles that display a statistical aggregate, e.g., an 'average' pattern, along with previews of the grouped snippets. In a way, HiPiler is augmenting human abilities to organize items with data-driven tools to handle exploration and visual pattern search for many regions in the context of a huge image. This enables biologists to evaluate the performance of pattern detection algorithms, remove outliers and noise, and assess the variance across pattern types to identify subgroups of pattern. These abilities allow for fast and interactively testing of hypotheses, which is highly important as a lack of ground truth data requires biologists to visually make sense and evaluate findings with their eyes.

And that is exactly what this visualization shows: whenever a train moves to the next station — and only for as long as a train is moving — the origin station moves towards the destination station. The faster the train, the closer it moves to its destination. And also, the more trains run from the origin to a destination, the more it moves towards its destination. When no train is moving from a certain station to a destination, that station will slowly move back to its original geographical location. My hypothesis was that the west of The Netherlands, the area between Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht is very well connected, and so the geography of the should distort very much in this area. But many stations have different destinations, so over time stations can be 'pulled' towards different destinations. And during night time, when almost no trains are running, almost all the stations will move back to their original geographical location. This visualization shows the train schedule in The Netherlands for 1 of the busiest days that have been scheduled: December 14, 2018 (it is not based on realtime data).

Cartographers use something called a ""projection"" to morph the globe into 2D map. The most popular of these is the Mercator projection. Every map projection introduces distortion, and each has its own set of problems. One of the most common criticisms of the Mercator map is that it exaggerates the size of countries nearer the poles (US, Russia, Europe), while downplaying the size of those near the equator (the African Continent). On the Mercator projection Greenland appears to be roughly the same size as Africa. In reality, Greenland is 0.8 million sq. miles and Africa is 11.6 million sq. miles, nearly 14 and a half times larger. This app was created by James Talmage and Damon Maneice.

To produce these posters, we collected open source data from the Mozambican government, UN agency and the aid relief partners working in the Shelter, Food, and Water clusters. Our analysis is displayed in three phases, the first is resettlement, which communicates the distribution of displaced individuals, ‘Relief’ shows the reported need and how/where resources were allocated, and ‘Return’ captures the change in perception and expectation of displacement. Our team presented the posters first to explain what data we would be using to create the data sculptures. Then small groups made up of architects, data analysts, and creatives alike crowded around their assigned district map, labeled with community populations, 'expected displacement time', and the top three most urgent needs. They were first tasked to build a 'needs' map from the lens of relief workers. Once they created their map, it was time to develop their strategy for relief according to the data that recorded needs of survivors and displaced households.

The index, from global design firm Arcadis and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, ranks cities’ success based on social, environmental, and economic factors. Arcadis used 32 indicators and a cross section of the world’s urban areas, so not all capitals or large cities are necessarily represented.

Our interactive visualisation enables users to sort countries by life expectancy (purple circles). But it also enables them to sort countries by retirement age (green circles for legal and brown for effective retirement age) as well as the difference between retirement age and life expectancy (bars in the middle) to see how much of old age life is spent in the labour market. These comparisons show surprising results in light of existing knowledge. It’s been reported that Korea will be the first country where life expectancy will exceed 90 years; it also has one of the lowest legal retirement age in OECD. Thus it seems that elderly in Korea are particularly lucky to live long after retirement. But when effective retirement age is considered, there is only one country where people have fewer years to live after retirement than in Korea.

The infographic was created to commemorate the March 1st Independence Movement centennial anniversary that collected and visualized more than 19,000 documents of the 40-year-old independence fighter's ruling from 1906 to 1945. Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905 was signed in 1905, and political interference from 1906 of the Japanese Empire began in earnest. Results of a review of organized data by replacing it with a distribution chart, right after the March 1st Independence Movement, data for about three years accounted for 62% of the total. Therefore, they added separate colors for concern of data becoming complicated.(green, blue) Through this infographic, you can see the activities for the independence of the people of the Korean Empire and the unfair legal suppression of it by the Japanese Empire. In particular, the number of convictions has exploded right after the uprising. This contrasts with the fact that most cases before the March 1st Independence Movement were acquitted.(violet) This shows that the Japanese Empire suppressed the people of the Korean Empire very hard.

2351	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2542-dragon-dance	Dragon Dance	Yang Zhangbin, Nanjing University of the Arts	"""Dragon dance"" is an introduction to the traditional Chinese cultural activity of dragon dance."" The dragon is a totem worshipped by the Chinese people for generations. In ancient times, the Chinese thought of the ""Dragon"" as the magical thing that can affect clouds and rain and avoid disasters. For thousands of years, the descendants of yanhuang have called themselves ""the descendants of the dragon"". Dragon dance is a set of Chinese traditional folk cultural activities as well an intangible cultural heritage. Every festival, people will do the dragon dance, an inheritance of the dragon's role in outstanding traditional culture . The dragon has ball joints to do all kinds of action and movement; thrusting, constantly showing tension, swinging, becoming supine, kneeling down, jumping, rolling, etc, and the different regional culture and dragon dances are also different. There are also many Chinese versions and variations. Therefore, praying for peace and a good harvest using the dragon dance became a traditional folk culture all over the country. In ancient times, the dragon dance was one of the biggest festivals in the year. The dragon ""dragon"", is placed according to the localised choreography of the dance, with banners, drums and horns, for leading the procession. The dragons are asked to come out from the temple, and the mount bibcock beaten, for the dot eyeball ceremony. The dragon body pieces are made of bamboo into a round dragon shape. They are attached to each other, and the outer covering has a large red cloth with dragon scales, with one person every five or six feet along the body, and the head and tail are about ten people apart. Historically, the dragon was led by one man, and the pole held a huge ball for guidance. In the dance, the huge ball is positioned around the left and right sides of the parade, and the dragon head is made as a ball, causing the dragon body to move. As Chinese people have emigrated around the world,  dragon dance culture has spread all over mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, southeast Asia, and Europe and the United States, Australia, New Zealand. Each Chinese concentrated area in these countries has adopted this symbol of Chinese culture. This work introduces the activity of Dragon Dance from various aspects."

Known for his strong interjections and his 140-character feuds with everyone from Rosie O’Donnell to Mac Miller, the now-president always makes the most of his quickly typed messages and his 32.7 million followers, a following which, as the New York Times pointed out, is 1.7 times larger than that of the official @POTUS twitter. In April, both the Washington Post and the New York Times dove into the President’s tweets over his first 100 days, cataloging and categorizing each, tracking his retweets, emojis, and busiest times, and discussing his repeated yells of “FAKE NEWS!” But I wanted to dive a little deeper into the @realDonaldTrump’s tweets, chirps, and occasional misfires over his first 100 days in office. This essay visualizes all 501 Trump tweets between January 20th and April 29th to find out what he was saying, how he was saying it, and when he was talking about it. We'll also look at the source of his messages and the tw-entiment (ha, get it?). It works best on Chrome on your desktop, but I won't fault you for scrolling through it on your mobile. We're going to look at this from plenty of different angles, and as such, this essay isn't meant as a full exploration of each, but rather a short and sweet investigation to serve as a jumping off point for a couple of future projects. Full credits are at the end of the article, but I make use of data from the Trump Twitter Archive.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	News & Current Affairs

This piece sought to inform and engage the audience by testing their knowledge of how much hidden sugar is lurking in everyday foods. The ABC News team started with the central question: ""The World Health Organisation wants us to limit our sugar intake to six teaspoons (25 grams) a day, but do you know how much of it is hiding in some of our most popular groceries?"" They came up with a purpose-built quiz format to present scientific information in a fun, engaging way. Behind the light-hearted, user-friendly interface and bespoke photography were weeks of painstaking research and analysis, ensuring the information was scientifically sound. The audience was given a score as they moved through the quiz, and then given more context and explanation to inform their food choices and help create a healthier population.

While Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures coined the term for these seemingly illusive companies in 2013, unicorns are no longer as mythological as investors think in 2015.  The goal of this infographic was to illustrate patterns about the unicorns. We used Fortune’s “The Unicorn List” article as a springboard to aggregate the 138 startups’ sectors, locations, ages, and the CEOs' gender and education. The results are fascinating. We then conducted desk research to collect more in-depth facts about each of these categories. After data aggregation, we analyzed the data for trends.

But it is not unique, it in part belongs to all of us that have fallen for another. The technology industry can, at times, earn its reputation for being so connected it distances us; so data obsessed it forgets context and so innovative it forgets history. This visualisation is the bridge between data, design and the most human story of all: love. What you see in ‘Written in the Stars’ is a graph visualised as a night sky. On the x-axis is time of day, the y-axis is months (from 2016 to present). The size of the star represents the number of words sent in each message between me and my now fiancé. As such, the bigger the star, the more that was written. The data is sourced from Facebook messenger, this being our platform of choice in getting to know one another. As you cast your eyes across the night sky you are taken on a journey from the exciting beginnings of a relationship. Early morning thoughts and late-night musings: constant communication. The chase. You have experienced it, that person is always on your mind. As you move across the sky, the relationship is secured and matures. Bigger stars illuminate life moments such as a time-zone change difference for a work trip, an early morning get up or, as labelled, a period of commuting to another city. As the stars peter out to the right of the view, so the relationship strengthens. Technology has served us in the beginning, enabled us at distance and then fades away, as connection becomes a meaningful daily encounter: living together. The story of this night sky tells the two tales of technology: as a tool to connect when apart and an unnecessary distraction from the present. The sky is constructed in a visualisation as if we are gazing up at the milky-way and reflecting on our relationship. The sky becomes less bold, but if you look closely it is a thing of beauty.

Jang Lee, London College of Communication	This project takes, as its starting point, the Sustainable Development Goals. The UN highlights how ‘The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all’ (United Nation, n.d.) In this project, my intention is to explore the concept of what ‘better’ means for nations and individuals. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a familiar and widely used measure of success for countries. But what can this tell us about the actual well-being of individuals? In this piece of work, GDP and levels of happiness are compared, and the possible relationship between types of industry and within different countries and GDP and levels of happiness explored. The intention of this outcome is to make individuals take another look at how we define success. It is intended as a starting point for a conversation about we value in our societies and what our goals for future development should be.

2408	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2338-solar-flares	Solar Flares	David Roberts	All solar flares laid over one another as you look at The Sun. Each flare is a circle. Since Feb 2002 there have been 115424 flares detected by the RHESSI mission. Most originate from The Sun (though some will be a Gamma-ray burst). The Sun is an interesting object as it can’t easily be observed by the casual observer (unlike, say, The Moon) and a lot of the structure and activity is hidden. This image is an attempt to show some of this activity. Importantly, all the scales are kept linear to show the range of this activity. The range of individual flares when combined show a larger, underlying structure for The Sun without fitting models or further measurement. Clearly two bands exist either side of the equator where the density of flares are greater, due to the magnetic field structure. Each flare is overlaid in date order with the size and color depicting the strength of the burst, with the previous flares showing through at half the intensity as they are overlaid. The center of each flare is the angular position of the flare origin on the sky, the exterior radius relates to the total counts on the RHESSI instrument, the inner relates to the duration. The color relates to the peak counts (red is a larger peak). Overlaid the final image is the density map of the origin of the flares and an off-set in brightness to depict the extent of The Sun’s disc. The brightness is a circular disc though the shape of The Sun may not be entirely spherical. Though, it seems as though some flares originate outside The Sun’s disc. This could be due erroneous detection or false signals in the instrumentation, but also could be flares from the opposite side of The Sun that are only observed once they have reached a certain distance from the surface.

One of the main reasons why is because Iran has still not implemented measures that would enable these citizens to live their lives on an equal level with those who do not have disabilities. These measures include compiling and publishing statistical and other forms of data on the community, and implementing the recommendations of the UN's Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities, which Iran ratified in 2009. For the first time ever, this fact sheet by the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) provides an overview of what it's like to live in Iran with a disability with so many of your basic needs out of reach. From the historical context, to daily financial struggles, this fact sheet touches on all the major issues faced by this vulnerable community of millions.

The Fortune 500 index is generally considered as a mirror of the economy. Here, we use data visualization to test this hypothesis: Can company ranking reflect economic growth? From those visualizations, we can conclude that China companies' performances are getting better, and there is a trend that more Chinese companies are entering the Fortune 500 list. Likewise, there are more Hong Kong companies on the list, and basically, Hong Kong company rankings are going upward. As for Taiwan, its economy has experienced various ups and downs, and fewer new Taiwanese companies have entered the list. To conclude, China and Taiwan economic fortunes are clearly reflected on the Fortune 500. However, Hong Kong's economic boom in recent years cannot be observed from the fortune 500 visualizations.

We explore this question with RecSys, a modern fable that examines through an every day event (a birthday party) the news ways we explore the world filtered by algorithms. Recommendations are as old as civilization, but today's experiences are directed and driven by algorithms that leverage massive amounts of other people's actions. Can we finally have access to every content ever created or every person on the planet? We argue that these new systems help us shorten time and space and position ourselves in a space of knowledge in which we could eventually always find the person, book, movie or product that we need at any given moment. This project was presented as an open debate and a unconcluded research that poses questions about unentended consequences of Recsys, such as echo chambers, lack of hunger for discovery and exploration, and privacy issues.

Therefore, we’ve launched an interactive to track Trump’s job approval and disapproval ratings.

From there, the road to Freising is not long - just three hours by car. However, considering the average age of its inhabitants, the distance could not be greater: 10,5 years separate the Thuringian town and the Bavarian district of one another. While in Suhl the population is aging and shrinking, the opposite takes place from 300 kilometers to the south. Young families flock from Munich to neighboring Freising, in order to find their luck in the countryside. These phenomena are explained by the rural exodus (especially from less-favored regions in the east), the urban exodus (from the expensive cities) and demographic change. Suhl was once synonymous in mining and gun making, now is weakening the economy, youth pulls away. In 2030 the average age in many land lines will be about as high as in Suhl today.

In raw votes, it was the largest popular-vote lead in history for a candidate who lost the election. The nature of the results has again stirred up debate about the merits of using the electoral college system. A state’s electoral votes are equal to the number of representatives and senators the state has in Congress. House seat apportionments are based on population and are reapportioned every decade after the census. Every state is guaranteed at least one seat in the House and two in the Senate. The electoral college is supposed to guarantee that populous states can’t dominate an election, but it also sets up a disparity in representation. While California has one electoral vote per 712,000 people, Wyoming — the least populous state in the country — has one electoral vote per 195,000 people.

2506	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2462-the-internet-muggles-project	The Internet Muggles Project	Re-lab	The development of malware has become more and more unpredictable in recent years. This indicates that the prevention of malware infection would become more difficult. It draws attention with turmoil and chaos, it leads to criminal acts and grand loss, but it stays underestimated for most individual Internet users. With all these trends and facts, it is surprisingly how the mainstream media reveal and discover so little of related information. As the phenomena in this high-tech era trigger our interests to scrutinize deeper, we have read and searched a quantity of materials, e.g. reports from Anti-virus software developers, instruction and introduction videos, news on malware infections, etc. We would briefly state that the project has enlightened us in two main perspectives. First, the reliable, systematic, and profession information of malware is not easy to attain. Second, it is nearly impossible to find user-orientated contents. Thus, we have concluded that most people would have little motivation and desire to learn more about malware-related information, and even if they have some, the suitable and feasible resources are still out of their reach. Sensing the fact that people pay little attention to prevention and protection when using computer, we have consulted a senior information security engineer, in hope of finding solution to raise people’s consciousness and comprehension of malware. The consultancy assured our determination to bring about this project. The engineer described how depressing it was the public’s refusal to acknowledge the importance of malware prevention. Her opinions motivate us to carry out this project, which starts with the interviewing Internet users, and concludes with some afterthoughts. The project initiates with the setting of one engineer, Randy, who has tolerated too much disturbance from his friends with constant requests of malware problems. He deems that most people are ignorant of malware, and he calls them “Internet Muggles” to declare his observation of these people. The whole project, from the engineer’s narrative, will suggest the common how to know and get along with malware, and above all, it will be user-orientated to interest the audience. Interviewing engineers and Internet users with malware-infected experiences, the project explores the risks according to the user’s habits, psychological cognition, and analyses on their crisis management. Among all interviewees, we have chosen six subjects and visualized all data related to the research. As the procedures go, we find it interesting that most subjects become more concentrated in the topic. They beware of the risks from data visualization of their user habits, and this approach succeeds catching their attention and anticipation to malware. In the end, the project further prompts useful advice to the subjects, regarding the development of malware as an inevitable issue and existence that modern people should beware of. This project, however, serves as our enthusiasm to study more, and hopefully we will continue execution next year, to prolong our research and build a more comprehensive project.

We defined mass shootings as events in which there are five or more victims, excluding the shooter. The circumstances and locations in which the attacks occurred are also detailed. Murders within the family circle are not included. The aftermath is visualised by indicating if the shooter was apprehended, killed by police, sentenced and executed, or committed suicide. The key also indicates if the attack is against people known to the perpetrator, or unknown members of the public. The visualisation demonstrates random attacks have increased. Readers can toggle between display settings to view the shooters chronologically or according to their ages at the time of the attack. The viewer is free to decide if the problem is exacerbated by the easy access to firearms in the US. Due to the increasingly common occurrence of these episodes in America, we wanted to create a visually powerful way for readers to respond to. We felt showing the faces of the perpetrators was chilling, poignant and memorable. This graphic was first published in May, 2018 and will be updated and republished each time a new massacre with more than five deaths is reported in the US.

The directions of lines were based on part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) and length is based on the length of the word. Star sizes are also based on word length.

I went about this by recording conversations between myself and Siri and then used the sound data from these conversations, to influence my typography and further visually capture the interaction. I chose to explore my conversations with Siri, because I was interested in the speech abnormalities in the conversation and how Siri provides unconventional answers, that a person would never say, ie.’I never rest. But thanks for asking.’ I presented my experiments in a series of posters, with the left half of the poster representing my speech/question to Siri and the other half representing Siri's response. I decided to keep each conversation/poster in the same typeface, as by representing my data in the same format, I was able to provide a more accurate comparison of the sounds. I experimented with illegibility, and how many points I needed to plot onto my type to make it legible. I also considered how loud the sounds could be before they became too illegible, and how my visual choices such as shapes added to the legibility, I found the square experiments expanded more, making them less legible than the polygons. I also added a caption of what was said, I felt that this added a needed context and possible entry point into the poster. Overall I found these experiments interesting to explore, as I was able to visualise a communication between myself and Siri where the answers were very unexpected and unlike that of what a person would respond. For my future experiments, I would like to further explore how I can represent a sound, by creating another interactive experience, which uses real-time data. I could perhaps look at more abstract visualisations which represent certain sounds, such as using shapes to represent sounds.

The top level is seeing all your favorite players.

Sentimental Analysis Analysis on how sentimental or emotional the news story is.i.e. if it's a positive, neutral, or negative angle.  Subjectivity Analysis Analysis on the subjectivity of the content. i.e whether the story is opinionated and subjective, or factual and objective in nature.  Content Analysis Living news performs analysis on what the content or topic is actually related to. It analyses the content and finds classifications or categories the content relates to. Framework: This framework can be extended to give a visual identity to google search results. i.e. analyzing the content of the search result links and then using those results to present visual clues on subjectivity, relevance or parameters which the user is interested in. Assisting people with different abilities especially deaf people, who can view real-time visualization on sentimental or language processing analysis and interpret it more clearly. Real-time visual map of YouTube videos with visualization of the emotions and narrative flow The visualization gives the news a visual identity as if it is an living cell which has its own characteristics and categories.

The finished piece was broadcast on all main domestic video outlets: BBC News bulletins, News channel and the news website. The brief was to create an innovative visual style based around new ideas and techniques. The motion graphics were designed to recreate, explain and integrate key facts about the Games and competitors into a report fronted by BBC presenter Sophie Raworth. Where some venues had not yet been completed - as in the case of Celtic Park - the design team had to seamlessly create those elements. At Hampden Park the graphics explained how a football stadium had been reversioned to accommodate world class athletics track. The graphics in some cases used simple existing techniques such as shooting over green screen and replacing the background with fixed shots, library video and animating text over video in After Effects. In others we used some of the most complex solutions available; such as tracking ground components, exporting data to replace those components with 3D objects and textures, also eliminating elements from shots, such as tracking points and unwanted objects.

As the second most widely consumed beverage, second only to water, tea has a lot more varieties than you would think. Like wine where the taste and smell of the final product is determined by the terroir, the soil and the elevation of the plantation determines the unique characteristics specific to that tea. All of the world’s tea (about 1,500 types) is produced from one species of the tea tree, the Camellia sinensis.  Depending on the location of the bush, the terrior, the leaves tenderness and size, time of harvest, and its production method (amount of fermentation), the resulting leaves develop its own distinct shape, color, aroma and taste that cannot be be produced elsewhere. The fermentation process, or the lack-thereof, determines the type of tea: White, Yellow, Green, Oolong, Black, and Dark. The teas below are grouped the province they originate from. Each province is listed from North to South. Within these regions, the teas are listed according to the elevation of the tea plantation. Both English and Chinese names are listed.

In the wake of extreme water stress events across the globe in places like Cape Town, Mexico City, and Australia, I wanted to explore often overlooked water issues here at home in the United States. Major factors like population growth, climate change, and crumbling infrastructure are causing regional water stress that will soon affect other areas of the country without action. In order to change our relationship with water, action must come in the form of both infrastructure investments and behavioral changes. I designed and built this web-based data-driven visual essay to explore how and where freshwater is used, current water stress in the United States, and behavioral vs. investment choices needed to conserve massive amounts of water.

After they are accepted into the adoption proccess, they also need to fill a form in which they declare which kind of child they are willing to take in. This is when characteristics such as age, existance of siblings, special needs, gender and race come into play. Long story short: the wannabe adoptive parents are looking for very specific traits. For most of the children and teenagers living at government foster homes, this makes the odds of moving in with a new family very low. Age is the most decisive factor: after one turns 10, the chances drop drastically. Along with that, having disabilities and siblings are also key factors. To show how parental preferences impact the likelihood of adoption, we developed a simulator that displays how long it would take for specific children to be selected. Each individual child is represented as a plant that grows as time passes.

However, more than a technical feature, VGI has brought to light the political aspects of cartography, when multiple stakeholders have access to mapping tools. This is the case of the collaborative mapping strategies used to map North Korea. OpenStreetMap (OSM) enables “armchair mappers” to map opaque territories in which local governments control citizens’ access to the internet. In this paper we discuss the following questions: Who is mapping North Korea in OSM? Which tools and methods do contributors use to gain access to information about the country and to represent it? What are the motivations behind this mapping endeavor? We analyze technical aspects of OSM data for North Korea and structured correspondence exchanged with 889 contributors. We argue that crowdsourced efforts can make good the dearth of knowledge resulting from the physical, cultural and political barriers associated with uncharted territories and that, although the motivations for such efforts vary greatly, they all have their origin in a sense of empathy and the power technology has to penetrate geopolitical barriers.

The parliament was against it. We wanted to know how much war material is already sold to warring countries. For this, we used Swiss government data on weapon exports and worldwide data on conflicts by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program to examine which proportion of weapon deals took place during times where the receiving country was involved in a conflict. We found that weapon exports to countries whose government is involved in an international or internal conflict increased since 2014, when the Swiss regulation on weapon exports was loosened. In 2017, exports to warring countries made for 30 % of all weapon exports. We further showed to which countries the largest shares were exported and explain the conflict situations in more detail for the countries to which Switzerland exported weapons during conflicts in ten years or more.

2630	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3917-house-of-cards	House Of Cards	ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)	In 2017, Australia’s housing market began the long slide into what has since become the worst property downturn in the country’s history. This project, published on the eve of the downturn claiming this dubious title, used exclusive data from analytics firm Corelogic to compare the decline to previous historical downturns. We sought to answer two key questions: - How bad is this decline? - How bad is this decline in specific neighbourhoods? DEFINE “BAD” A house price slump can be bad because the decline is: a) big b) widespread c) sharp/steep d) sustained, or e) a combination of the above. We relied on several datasets to examine how the 2017-18 decline compared on each of these measures – nationally, and in each of Australia’s eight capital cities. ILLUSTRATE “BAD” We used suburb maps of the eight capital cities to show the geographical distribution of house price changes over the past decade We then examined 38 capital city housing downturns recorded since 1980, using a line chart to plot how sharply prices fell and how long each downturn lasted. We highlighted the impact at the top end of the property market via: - a bar chart showing the price change in Australia’s million-dollar postcodes - a line chart showing how the sudden drop in the number of million-dollar postcodes Using detailed historical data to examine the decline from multiple angles, we showed that the decline was not the sharpest nor most widespread (yet) but was on track to be the largest, particularly in Australia’s two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. HOW BAD IS IT FOR YOU? We built two interactive databases to show users personalised results. These tools allowed users to compare the data for their neighbourhood to other neighbourhoods in their local area or state. The tools worked like this: - When users enter a postcode or suburb, the tool matches it to three other geographic areas: their region, council area and state. - A line chart compares that postcode’s median house price over 21 years (1998-2018) to every other postcode in that state - this is the “big picture” - Users can filter that view to only the postcodes in their region, or other regions in their state - Scrolling down, users then come to a column chart, which shows how far house prices in their council area have fallen since their peak - This chart can be filtered to show only council areas in a state/territory - The databases are linked so users only need to enter their suburb or postcode once. The second search bar allows users to enter a new suburb or postcode if they want to explore the data further These tools showed that national or even city-wide figures mask significant differences between local areas, with some neighbourhoods hit far harder than others.

2635	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3073-a-matter-of-scales	A Matter of Scales	University of Iowa Mobile Museum	A Matter of Scales is an interactive data exhibit meant to tell the story of the pangolin—an order of animals that faces endangerment and extinction due to illegal trade thanks to demand for the creature for traditional Chinese medicine. Many think that the scales of pangolins have medicinal properties, however, there is no evidence and a pangolin’s scales are made of keratin, the same material of the human fingernail. This project exists within the intersection of data visualization, physical artifact, interaction, science communication, and informal science learning and is an attempt to shed light on the man-created plight of these creatures. The data sculpture is modeled after a giant pangolin, the largest of eight species of pangolins, and made to scale. The sculpture possesses 115 interactive scales, each laser cut by area to a data point representing how many pangolins were accounted for in a single confiscated illegal shipment. These data scales are interactive and, when a person touches one, a signal is sent to a second geodata-based visualization on an accompanying screen. Upon touch, this visualization focuses on the data point, showing where in the world the shipment was seized, where it was heading (if data available), and more. This project was commissioned by and currently installed in the University of Iowa Mobile Museum for the 2018 touring season.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Unusual;Longlist
2636	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1080-chip-contextual-and-historical-influences-in-psychology	CHIP: Contextual and Historical Influences in Psychology	Stardotstar	This data driven research tool was commissioned by The Open University to help academics in the field of psychology to explore different perspectives that exist within psychology methods as well as the different methods used in psychological enquiry. Chip takes data from an old, outdated academic interactive database (EpoCH) and reimagines over 30,000 lines of data, to create a playful research tool for use by students within the OU Exploring Psychology online course. The challenge in building this tool was to take this large database of content and find a way of representing it in a beautiful, engaging and simple to understand visualisation which inspires exploration to find new links which highlight psychology narratives. We produced a psychology Starfield which could be explored in a number of different ways to unveil links between different contexts, perspectives and methods to create an acutely detailed story of how the psychology discourse found it’s way into the present day state. The Starfield; a plotted graph across an X axis timeline, mapped the links between different researchers and academic traditions of understanding, to form a beautiful, colourful galaxy of information. Colour was a key mechanic in differentiating types of information. We also used a variety of node size visualisations to allow users to see how prevalent each node was (ie. how many links it has). This iPad first experience was designed to be fully responsive and works intuitively across all devices; iPad, laptop, desktop and even modern mobile browsers can support the tool. For the mobile version we had to reassess the information architecture as the Starfield was too small to decipher on such a small screen, so we designed a solution where all of the nodes are still available in list form. We worked closely with a team of academic researchers to make sure that all of the data we needed to tell the most accurate story, was available, correct and up to date. As the field of psychological understanding is developing so rapidly, we needed to be able to make the database updatable and so created an easy to use, bespoke Content Management System (CMS) and also a nominations form which allows users to suggest additions to the administrators, which in turn will be discussed with a board of prestigious specialists in the field to decide if they are prolific enough to be added to the database. To improve the discovery aspect of the tool we thought it would be helpful to create more editorially lead narratives, which visually unfold as you follow the narrative along its path. The Narrative function allows a story to animate across the Starfield, explaining each connection as they unfold across the timeline. Chip is live and already being used by students and lecturers across the Open University and has been celebrated as one of the most useful tools of its kind by the industry. We wish there was room for quotes!	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2015	Longlist;Interactive Visualization

A Prodigioso Volcán and Kloshletter agencies initiative to highlight the life and work of Spanish known and unknown women who have made important contributions in one way or another to society. Sometimes they died being unknown or even being rejected for it. For months, almost 200 writers, journalists and illustrators have voluntarily participated in the writing and illustration of the 100 stories that so far (September / 2019) have been published on the web http://www.nomecuentescuentos.com/ This visualization shows an analysis of data that these 100 stories have given us about the women who star in them. We begin with a (who) circular dendrogram with women categorized according to the field in which they developed their professional career or the milestones through which they went down in history. We use a color code to identify these categories, code that will be maintained throughout the infographic. The following graphic (what), breaks down the diagram in each of its ramifications to include a brief category description. We continue visualizing the data in a timeline (when) of their lives. The illustrations that accompany this timeline represent the women or elements they worked with (a plane honors the first female pilot in Spain, an orangutan to the director from the orangutan center Jane Goodall, etc). Finally, a locator map (where) helps us identify the place of origin of women, which is useful to know where more female artists, or more scientific or activists, come from within the 100 analyzed.

Fans and commenters have historically said yes they do, but sports data analysts have claimed believers in streaks are forcing a narrative onto what is really just statistical noise. Two writers for FiveThirtyEight decided to build a model to settle the question once and for all — if they could successfully predict whether or not a pitcher was in a hot or cold streak, then it would prove such streaks exist. They built their model and found that they could indeed predict streaks. Then they determined the impact a cold or hot streak has on a pitcher's fastball speed. The main data visualization in this story is of just that: we took every pitcher, showed his average fastball speed, how much the average speeds up during hot streaks and how much it slows down during cold streaks.

This is a data visualisation showing the evolution of Billboard's top-charting music between 2007 and 2017. This was originally a university assignment, which I further refined to create my submission entry. The data is based on Billboard's Year-End charts from which I took the first 5 top charting songs of each year and collected data on the genre and BPM of each individual song. The overall design is meant to represent the music’s digital soundwaves. Each bar represents a song, and the colours are assigned to each bar represent the genre(s) of each particular songs. The height of the bar is determined by the BPM of the song; if it is a slow song, the length of the bar is going to be long, and the opposite if the song is fast. The white space behind the bars is based on the average BPM of the top 5 songs of each year. One of the most challenging parts in creating this data visualisation is condensing down the information into a visual medium. Some songs may have over 5 different genres, which also include sub-genres and fusion, which is hard to represent them all in the design. I decided to use the bulk of the information from a website called Discogs to categorise the genre of the songs.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Longlist;Arts, Entertainment & Culture

In 2019, more than 600 million people voted in the general election across the nation. To aid visual analysis on this vast data, we created an online interactive tool which allows for an exploration of how political parties have performed in the past 5 elections. Our tool provides a seamless and interactive experience by visually bonding different elements through their attributes and animations. From the data obtained from Election Commission of India (ECI), we categorized the data into three critical dimensions: year of the election, the constituency and its geographic location, the parties which contested elections. Our visualization consists of three sub-visualizations, each giving a unique insight into every dimension of the data: Alliances: A meta level visualization of how major political alliances have performed in the entire nation. We represent the geographic map using a gridded cartogram to prevent the area bias of map presentation, in which the user is misled to associate the color of the geographic area with the data when it's not. Since cartograms are not very popular in Indian media, we expected that people not exposed to gridded cartogram will not be able to understand the visualization. Hence we have provided an option to switch between the cartogram and geographic map. State Map: An in-depth visualization of parties performance in different constituencies of a state. A tooltip in rollover provides additional information about the winning parties in different elections. When a constituency is clicked, the tooltip reveals an in-depth analysis of the top 5 parties in every election through a rank map. The rank visualization gives a way to track the performance of a single party across all years. Voter Margin: A visual analysis of how dominating was the winning party in a particular constituency. We defined the success of their performance with the difference of votes between the winning party and the runner party, also known as ""voter margin"". In some constituencies, the difference in votes may be high due to the higher population in that constituency. Hence we also provide an option to toggle the data from raw votes to the percentage of votes which normalizes the effect of the higher population in that particular constituency.

Fabrice Sabatier	There is something wrong with the global financial system.  While that idea is widely shared since the 2008 crisis, we still don’t fully understand what needs to be changed, and what we can do to make change happen. Finance 4 Citizens is a groundbreaking initiative gathering top European economists and influential artists to help people take action for a better, fairer financial system.  Our research team explores how to build a stable financial system turned towards long-term investments – which are sorely required to reach a more sustainable, more innovative, less unequal and greener EU economy. Our artists will contribute to this vision by re-connecting finance to our European values, cultures and dreams.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2015	Longlist;Interactive Visualization

To illustrate this, we created a map of recent changes on Wikipedia, which displays the approximate location of unregistered users and the article that they edit. When an unregistered user edits Wikipedia, he or she is identified by his or her IP address. These IP addresses are translated to users' approximate geographic location, and placed on a map. The blue dots indicate an addition, and a red dot indicate a subtraction. Unregistered users only make a fraction of total edits -- only 15% of the contributions to English Wikipedia are from unregistered users. Edits by registered users do not have associated IP information, so the map actually represents only a small portion of the total edit activity on Wikipedia. You may see some users add non-productive or disruptive content to Wikipedia. A survey in 2007 indicated that unregistered users are less likely to make productive edits to the encyclopedia. Do not fear: improper edits will be removed or corrected by other users, including you!	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Interactive Visualization

Coe	Cartographers are tasked with making the physical world understandable through graphical display. Abstract spatial data is given context and translated through elements such as north arrows, scale bars, and legends. The very reason this imagery works is because it ignores those cartographic principles and retains the element of the abstract. It allows the viewer to be intrigued by something that is at once familiar as well as mysterious. The image is a digital elevation model of the Willamette River and its environs that displays a 50-foot elevation range, from low elevations (displayed in white) fading to higher elevations(displayed in dark blue). It was created using high-resolution LiDAR data. To the scientist, this shows the meander scars that define the massive movements the river has made over thousands of years. To the non-scientist, this image may appear as a wisp of smoke, an electrical storm, or something equally as imaginative.

Every child is the support and hope of every Chinese family. Lost children are common in china, and fortunately the situation is improving with the spread of the internet in China. Nearly 40,000 missing, trafficked and adopted children have been registered on china's largest child tracing website. Their loved ones are waiting for them to return home. I collected data on lost children registered on the site from 1978 to 2018. I want to know which period has the most lost children? Are there significant quantitative differences between different economic regions? Are there significant differences in the number of lost boys and girls? Data show that the 1980s to the 1990s is the highest number of lost children in China. Despite the rapid economic development, some chinese families are still facing financial pressure, so they have no choice but to leave their second and third children for foster care or abandon them. At the same time, the phenomenon of abduction and trafficking also began to run rampant. As far as the regional distribution is concerned, the problem of lost children is most serious in Western China, such as Sichuan, Guizhou, and so on, whilst the situation in the eastern part of china is relatively good. The number of missing girls in central China, such as Jiangxi and Anhui, is almost twice as high as that of boys, which may be related to the local culture of ""Son preference"". Overall, however, the number of lost girls and boys is about the same. I hope to arouse the public's attention to this database, so that more parents can get their children back in their later years. This is the original intention of my creation of this work."	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Longlist;Humanitarian

One of the main advantages of a digital poster is that it can display dynamic content. This is at the same time the essential statement of the scientific poster ""Dynamic Planet"": our earth never stands still, is permanently shaken by earthquakes. These tensions are measured by three measuring points of the GFZ and their data is visualized in real-time in an interactive poster in the exhibition context. The viewer is given a direct impression, he can be a ""witness"" to current measurement and research. The challenge for the interface design was to ensure a clear overview, despite of the massively many events. The solution consists in an interactive graphical representation of the events by filtering the earthquakes by eg. magnitude and depth. A special visual feature of the scientific poster ""Dynamic Planet"" is the representation of the earthquakes depth in a semi transparent, rotating globe. This interactive 3D visualization and the level of detail is very unique also to the scientists and although there are millions of data points the responsiveness of the 3D model is very accurate. The content of the „Dynamic Planet” is structured in three chapters: Where do earthquakes happen? How do earthquakes occur? Exploration of the planet. In the last chapter graphical animations and network visualizations explain how the earthquake warning system is concepted and how data and information about earthquakes is transmitted. https://vimeo.com/220946297"	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Shortlist;Longlist;Silver;Winners;Science & Technology

Since the turn of this century China, the US, and various European and Asian countries, set up military camps in Djibouti. In fact, the resource-poor, tiny nation in the Horn of Africa plays host to more foreign military facilities than anywhere else in the world. Beijing claims it is a key strategic location to supply regional peacekeeping and humanitarian missions and combat piracy.

Actually, those in their 60s are as guilty as those in their teens – and the amount of time that all age groups spend staring at screens is rising. Among younger people, time with friends is losing out. Data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), an annual survey run by the Bureau of Labour Statistics, show that 15- to 24-year-olds are spending 15% less time socialising on their weekends and holidays than their equivalents did a decade ago.

The Paper and Sixth Tone collected hundreds of ads from the “marriage market” in People’s Park, a centrally located park in Shanghai, China. What’s special about these ads is that they are written by the parents, instead of the people who are looking a spouse. These ads say something about Chinese views on relationships – maybe some outdated views – but still important views since Chinese parents are deeply involved in their children’s marriage decisions. In the interactive product, we offer the readers a chance to click and see each ad before going into a macro-level analysis (all ads are desensitized). Because many of the readers (even local Chinese readers) may not be familiar with this matchmaking option, the individual ads may help them get a quick and rough idea about it. Comparison of genders is the main theme for the analysis. Each pink dot represents a woman and each blue dot represents a man in the “marriage market”. The dots are clustered to different groups as the analysis goes on. Some of the findings are expected (e.g. men are looking for younger women and women are looking for older men), and some surprise us (e.g. a lot of women don’t mind a man without an apartment). Although this analysis is primarily a quantitative one, we added some qualitative demonstration to capture the more individualized phrasings in these ads. For example, detailed descriptions of home are presented directly to contrast the unoriginality parents show in describing their children’s characters and personalities.

Over 69,000 people lost their lives in the quake, and it has become the most painful memory for many since then. Near the 10th anniversary of Wenchuan Earthquake, The Paper launched an UGC (User Genereted Content) project to create an online memorial archive for the quake, by simply asking ""where were you when the earthquke struck""? The project was designed to welcome memories from all kinds of people, victims or non-victims, Chinese or foreigners, from mobile or desktop. Each story is visualized as a dot on the map, with colors representing different moods. People who were near the epicenter shared emotions like fear(purple) and despair(yellow) when the quake struck, while people from faraway were more likely to be worried and saddened at that moment. We believe all memories are valuable, and should have the same chance to be shared on this project. In order to help users find the stories they are most interested in faster, we designed sorting and searching functions. The users can also find stories by clicking on dots on the map.

Some people wished Brexit would happen faster. Some didn’t want it, but will get on with it anyway. Others were waiting for a chance to stop it from happening at all. And there were those who said Britain is being upended—for better or for worse—by a decision they shouldn’t have had to make. Bloomberg reporters visited nine locations to talk Brexit, interviewing 133 people in late February for this chronicle of the country’s transition. A simple icon system for the main data points--how they voted in Brexit vs how they’d vote now--runs through the whole piece. Reorganizing them into different graphics based on the survey questions divulge patterns among the various types of voters and their financial and emotional attitudes.

2760	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/501-carbon-majors-drink-cans	Carbon Majors - Drink Cans	Adam Nieman	The Carbon Majors project (www.carbonmajors.org) is the culmination of eight years of combing through publicly available records about fossil fuel extraction from all across the globe and detailed analysis of the data. The project covers oil, coal, natural gas and cement production from the 1850s through 2010. The Report names the institutions responsible for extracting the oil, coal and gas that’s causing warming of the planet. Instead of allocating between countries, as has up to now been the case, any institution that produced more than eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide in any given year is identified in the study together with their cumulative contribution to the problem we all now face.  One problem with data like this is that it feels ‘unreal’ to people who are not already engaged with the issues. That is to say, it can be dismissed as just an intellectual exercise – just numbers. The main goal of this visualisation is to make the quantities real. We are talking about actual pollution that has affected the whole atmosphere, including the air we are breathing right now. Quantifying it in relation to the air in a real room gives viewers something concrete to relate to. Our package included conventional and novel ways to give a feel for the scale of the cumulative emissions involved. Amongst the visuals, perhaps most novel of all are the soda cans branded with well known names such as Chevron, Exxon, Aramco, BP and Gazprom which are presented as if filled – in the case of Chevron – or part-filled with carbon dioxide gas to show by volume precisely how much carbon dioxide is in a typical small room (5.4 x 5.4 x 2.7m at 400 ppmv concentration) as a consequence of these companies’ extractions.  The (true) claim in the visualisation is this: ‘in every small room, there is a soda can full of carbon dioxide that was supplied by Chevron’. That is a real and immanent way of conceiving the impact of the carbon majors, which communicates more to an unengaged audience than, ‘Cumulative emissions attributable to Chevron in 2010 were 51,096 MtCO2e’. Presenting the data this way challenges the idea that the human impact on the atmosphere is too small to worry about. It does this simply: by relating the numbers to people’s actual experience of being in a room.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2014	Longlist;Data visualization

Swinburne University of Technology	"The title of the Project is ""WordoScope- what do words say about Horoscope. The project was developed from data which had a set of words. This data was collected from 2200 horoscopes and had words describing each of the zodiac signs. The process of the project was a part of academic work for data visualisation. There are 12 zodiac signs: Pisces, Taurus, Leo, Aquarius, Gemini, Virgo, Aries, Libra, Scorpio, Cancer, Capricorn, and Sagittarius. Characters were created for each of the zodiac signs portraying the characteristics from the described interpretations. The data was processed by identifying the constantly used words and unique words further interpreting descriptions for each character. A storyline was created with a situation where all the characters are attending a party and having a conversation which depicts their descriptions. The challenges faced were to show their characteristics only from facial or body gestures, so adding dialogue boxes and adding a conversation made it a lot more easier to understand the Characters. The motive of the illustration is to create a storyline for people who read (newspaper or online) their weekly horoscope to make it more interactive and fun.

ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)	"Deepfakes — which use machine learning to create fake videos — burst onto the internet in 2017 and were decried as the end of trust, having the potential to bring down democracy, and evidence of reality unravelling before our very eyes. A number of articles talked up the apocalyptic potential of the technology, usually citing the same academic examples and relevant quotes from experts in the field. We wanted to try something more ambitious and actually create our own deepfakes, so that we could authoritatively understand the technology involved and answer the question of how they might be used to create fake news. At a deeper level, we aimed to use this story as a vehicle to build the audience’s understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning in general. We used the process of creating a deepfake of the Australian prime minister as the structure of the story. We were the first (and so far only) news organisation to use publicly available imagery and machine learning software to do this. To tell a story that is, at its heart, about imagery, the visuals had to be central to our approach. It is a perfect example of a story where the design and interactivity are central to the telling of the story, requiring close collaboration between the journalist, designer and developer. Each step in the process was explained and visualised through a series of interactive graphics that unfolded as the user scrolled. The seamless nature of the narrative belied the complexity of both the subject matter and the visual execution. The story was exceptionally well-received within the AI community, including praise from one of the scientists behind the groundbreaking 'Deep Portraits' we used in the story. It was also praised by computer science lecturers, and added to some syllabi on this subject. It won praise in the Pudding’s best visual and data-driven stories of 2018 awards, where the judges said: ""It was not only fun and novel in its execution, but a great example of explanatory, visually-driven journalism. Breaking down for readers how DeepFakes works — pixel-by-pixel — and using a real world example to ground the software's potential for misuse was both chilling and informative. I also appreciated the way in which the ABC treated the reader as an equal in their journey to discover how DeepFakes works, making it accessible to both a really plugged-in reader and a casual observer.""

Suddenly he couldn’t pick up our son, rock him to sleep or even change a dirty nappy. Let’s say that I was pretty motivated to help him heal as fast as possible. I did quite a lot of searching and found an excellent article on how bones heal, and nutritional support for the different stages of bone healing. It was quite long and dense, so I decided to try and visualize it. I researched (ok, googled) the foods highest in each of the vitamins and minerals that help support bone healing, and then mapped out which foods cover the most bases using an overlapping bubble/Venn diagram approach. There might be a few missing elements as I was largely sleep deprived during the development! We found the end product really helped us make better choices around what we were eating, as I hung a printed version of the graphic next to our kitchen fridge. The results were surprising–although obviously anecdotal and influenced by multiple factors–my husband had his cast removed 2 weeks early, and was told he needed no further treatment!

Unlike rainfall, it doesn't come as one burst that's here and then quickly gone. Instead, it tends to accrue over the winter and slowly melt as the temperatures rise in the spring. The melt typically continues into the early summer, providing a steady, consistent level of water in mountain watersheds. This is particularly important for states on the Pacific coast, which receive little summer rainfall.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Maps, Places & Spaces

Making sense of data in a business context seems like a harder task. Business leaders are still anxious about how Big Data can add actual business value, and refrain from investing in it.  Challenge While IBM continues its 100 year legacy and analytics expertise in India, Mint newspaper reports state that awareness of the possibilities of big data amongst business leaders is relatively limited. This comes as an impediment to IBM's sales team, while opening a conversation with prospects. Is there a way IBM could infuse more life into data and analytics, so as to drive preference and consideration for IBM Analytics, by creating a sales enabling conversation starter?  Opportunity IBM had to humanise Big Data and Analytics and make it relevant for their Indian audience – be it the CXOs of enterprises & start-ups or even the new buyers i.e. developers and the millennial segments. To hit the right note, IBM analysed the three aspects of life any Indian connects themselves to: Films, Cricket and Religion. With films trending every week and religion being too sensitive a topic, cricket seemed like the best topic to utilize, with the 2015 ODI Cricket World Cup right around the corner. Cricket, as a game, has a rich history of analysis, given the amount of data it generates. And the game being treated on par with a religion in India, every Indian assumed that he/she was an expert in the game and its statistics. So, IBM had the unique opportunity to analyse the most-analysed game in the country and present path-breaking insights out of it to outthink the average Indian cricket fan.  So what did IBM do? Staying completely off conventional cricket-related social media content that treads on live scores updates, live commentary and trivia, IBM shared dramatically different data-led insights.  This included, 1. Moneyball moments in cricket for the first time – to find ‘effective’ players in the context of each match, in association with Wisden’s Impact Index. 2. Most talked about moments and trending sentiments using social media data on each match. These were shared for every single match played during the 45 day tournament. The insights were then amplified both socially and digitally.  Starting on Feb 13th 2015, IBM went full-throttle to market with the hero channel that drove all the conversations around the World Cup analysed by IBM Analytics - @ScoreWithData . This acted as a real-time newsroom whose content was further amplified through digital, social and TV. Right from the most socially sought after batsmen, cricketer or team at the world-cup to the much spoken about topics around cricket to the most hard-working brands during the World Cup – all of this make up only a small pie of the gamut of insights shown on the twitter channel. Social Data Accelerator, Cognitive computing, Social Sentiment Analysis, Cloudant and few others were some of the IBM Analytics and Cloud tools used for mining insights. This exercise continued till the March 28th – when the final World Cup match was played.  How was this done? This infographic basically explains the process behind the insights delivered. It breaks it down in a step by step process and explains how insights were generated using IBM Analytics and Cloud tools. This infographic is currently being used as a conversation starter/enabler for the Sales guys when they meet prospective clients. It helps IBM's clients (even new buyers) to understand the back-end process involved in deriving the insights.  	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2015	Longlist;Infographic

How long has the sun gone wandering? We charted three infographics to mark this historically-remarkable rainy winter.  The first infographic shows the general weather pattern of February. Each quarter of a circle represents a point-in-time, 8 a.m., 11 a.m., 2 p.m., and 5 p.m. Five types of weather are colored differently from yellow to blue. The dominantly bluish infographic with scattered yellow sectors confirms people's experience of a dominantly rainy February with very occasional sunshine.  Secondly, we mapped out the volumes of rain and sun in different cities in China. Larger and less transparent dots indicate larger volumes while smaller and more transparent dots mean smaller volumes.  The last part is two listicles of southern Chinese cities that broke their records in the past six decades and cities that didn't in terms of rain and sunshine. The inner polar bar chart represents the number of rainy days in winter for each of the past sixty years, and the outer polar bar chart represents the hours of sunshine in winter. The light yellow shading of the outer part reminds people of the image of the sun's halo.  This work is a collaboration between The Paper and our sister publication Sixth Tone.

When Social Vulnerability Goes Hand In Hand With Fear Of Crime	David Bihanic	In the words of Bill de Blasio and his team members, the New York City government would be at the brink of definitively rooting out crime, that is to say putting an end to all forms of violence against persons, as well as violations of their physical (and mental) safety starting with the most serious: intended and unintended killings and aggravated assaults. The statistics speak for themselves, argue the elected local officials ; the rate of crime is constantly decreasing: 330 intentional homicides in 2017, compared with 334 in the previous year, according to the New York Times; a record rate, the lowest since the end of World War II. A spectacular fall regarding to the dramatic peak of 2,245 deaths recorded in 1990. Let us remind ourselves the commitment made at the time by Rudolph Giuliani (former mayor of the city) to pursue a “Zero-Tolerance” policy against crime (a slogan borrowed from Ronald Reagan). The Republican had then engaged in a fierce fight against offenders and criminals promising the inhabitants the return to a quality of life lost during the previous decade. This was his second aim (and slogan): the famous “Quality of life policing”. What is the concrete situation today? If the crime rate has indeed declined, does that mean, arithmetically, the quality of people’s lives is improving? And if so, does the living conditions really progress for all citizens? In the present webmap, I’ve reconciled two datasets: a first one drawing up a list of the major crimes committed in NYC during the year 2017 (such as murders, assassinations, beatings and further types of physical attacks) — these data are provided by the police authorities — and a second one listing a whole series of measures dealing with the social vulnerabilities on the territory — Social Vulnerabilty Index are produced by Regional Plan Association. The conclusion is clear: if the quality of life is apparently improving for certain individuals, many others still fall prey to crimes which are rampant in some boroughs, quarters an streets where social distress is most acute. We are all aware of the huge social fragmentation that splits the city in two (are residing in NYC both the very rich and the very poor). But what may be less well known is that misery, poverty and state fragility are often, if not always, linked to insecurity, physical (also psychological) suffering and constant fear.

There is no universally accepted definition of a mass shooting, and different organizations use different criteria. In this piece we look at the deadliest mass shootings, beginning Aug. 1, 1966, when ex-Marine sniper Charles Whitman killed his wife and mother, then climbed a 27-story tower at the University of Texas and killed 14 more people before police shot him to death. The numbers here refer to 127 events in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter (or two shooters in three cases). An average of seven people died during each event, often including the shooters. This data — compiled from Mother Jones; Grant Duwe, author of “Mass Murder in the United States: A History,” and Washington Post research — does not include gang killings, shootings that began as other crimes such as robberies, and killings that involved only the shooter’s family.

2909	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2378-those-places-high-speed-rail-hsr-could-take-you-to	Those places High-speed rail (HSR) could take you to	Caixin Media Company Limited	High-speed rail has developed rapidly in China in recent years. Its maximum speed has recently increased, to 350 kilometers per hour, and it has shortened the trip from Beijing to Nanjing to 3.5 hours. Therefore, high-speed rail has become the first choice for journeys below four hours (and even for longer trips considered the frequently-occurring flight delays). The existing map-based application or ticketing websites work only if people have decided both their departure city and destination. However, when it comes to choose holiday destinations, people are more concerned about the travel time and all reachable destinations within it are welcome. This project is to solve that problem. The project: 'Those places High-speed rail (HSR) could take you to', is a visualized interactive map that shows high-speed rail lines within 1/2/3/4 hours from any picked city in China. For example, departing from Beijing, the map shows that the high-speed rail will take passengers to Tianjin within one hour, to Jinan within two hours, to Zhengzhou within three hours and to Nanjing within four hours, etc. It also shows famous scenic sites along the railway. To develop this project, we used web crawler technology to extract data from the train timetables at 12306.com, the official railway ticketing website. Then we wrote functions that could calculate the travel time of any two stations and code it with programming language d3.js. Finally, we designed this zoomable interface which shows results with simple and elegant data visualization. In addition, in the mobile version the departure station will be automatically chosen according to the device’s current location. The project is both useful and educational. Not only being a powerful tool to choose travel destinations, it also demonstrates interesting geographic and economic knowledge of China. For example, more developed cities have more high-speed railway lines. And if you look at the southeastern part of China, lines are much shorter than in other part, meaning that the train cannot travel as far within the same time, and this makes sense because it is a mountainous area. Making it simple but informative, our goal is to let our readers spend more time to play around with the map, get their problems solved, and leave with interesting findings.

2925	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3904-the-changing-sound-of-popular-australian-music	The Changing Sound Of Popular Australian Music	ABC News (Australia)	The Triple J Hottest 100 countdown is the world’s largest music poll. Each year more than 2 million Australians pick their favourite songs and the tracks with the most votes are revealed one-by-one in a day-long broadcast. In Australia, it has become something of a cultural institution sparking debate about the changing sound of popular music and which generation had the better musical taste. The problem with many of these arguments is that they are largely based on feelings and memories - rather than on any hard data. Our project ‘The Changing Sound of the Hottest 100’ sought to change that. Using Spotify’s API, we collected data on almost every song that has made it into the countdown between 1993 and 2018. The data contained the same information the streaming service uses to power its recommendation engine. This data included information about track length, genre, tempo and key as well as more granular information like a song’s mood, its energy, how well you can dance to it or how acoustic a track is. Using these findings we revealed some fascinating changes in Australia’s popular music culture. Songs were getting sadder, slower, yet oddly they were now much better to dance to. The data was also the engine for the centrepiece of the article: an interactive component that allowed users to experience the changing sound of the countdown from year-to-year. The audience could listen to a sample of the top songs for each year while seeing the musical features that made that year unique, like how happy or energetic or slow the year was on average. It also gave people a sense of how the genres that made up the top 100 changed over the years. We wanted this to be a journey for the audience. For them to not only hear the sound of the Hottest 100 changes, but to see it and feel it too. To do that the changes in the interactive were tied to beats and sound of the music.

Bloomberg compiled and analyzed data from organizations that monitor the health of democracies to graphically portray this distressing global phenomenon that affects billions of people around the world. The story’s main graphic combines the overarching global environment with individual stories of countries facing crises of democracy. On first view, the graphic shows diverging top-level trends: more countries are having elections while the world, on average, becomes less democratic. Then it guides readers through individual cases of countries where democratic declines have been particularly striking. Following the guided narrative, the graphic is designed for exploration. Country by country, readers can explore each nation’s rises, falls and ranks for more than a century. Original reporting and additional charts begin to paint a portrait of why this trend is occurring. Stacked bar charts visualize polls showing that young citizens of some democracies view living in a democracy as less important than older generations and that they are more open to authoritarian governments than their parents and grandparents. Wrapping up the story, a final graphic provides a novel way of depicting how world leaders have blown through previous term limits.

2934	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2384-science-paths	Science Paths	Kim Albrecht	How does the impact of a scientist's work change over a scientific career? Does impact, arguably the most relevant performance measure, follow predictable patterns? Can we predict the timing of a scientist’s outstanding achievement? Driven by these questions, we studied the evolution of productivity and impact throughout thousands of scientific careers. We reconstructed the publication record of scientists from seven disciplines, connecting each paper with its long-term impact on the scientific community as quantified by citation metrics. We found that the highest-impact work in a scientist’s career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. This result is known as the random impact rule. In this visualization, we show the random impact rule in all its power. You can explore careers in different disciplines, rank scientists according to different career parameters, or select a subset of them. You will always find the impact peaks occurring all over the place, from the beginning of a career on the left to the end of a career on the right.

Since the early 1990s, Lujiazui has been developed specifically as a new financial district of Shanghai. The decision to earmark Lujiazui for this purpose reflects its location: it is located on the east side of the Huangpu River in Pudong, and sits directly across the river from the old financial and business district of the Bund. Currently, there are more than 30 buildings over 25 stories high with commerce as their primary function, and over 504 domestic and overseas financial and insurance corporations located in Lujiazui. The success of Lujiazui in the past 20 years has fueled tourism and business related travel to Shanghai. Pictures of the Lujiazui skyline dominate Shanghai tourism materials.

The research showed that the possibilities for future use of augmented reality and virtual reality are literally endless, and it has the potential to be utilized in many different industries across the globe. In addition, the research showed that consumers enjoy increased information and interactivity whilst using augmented reality and virtual reality. The research findings then led me to design, develop, and create an augmented reality enabled poster concept aimed at young children, to be used in a school setting, to teach and also entertain. I chose the subject of space for the infographic, as it is in the UK National Curriculum for children of a young age, thus rendering the infographic useful. Included are countless large and small written and visual details, in order to emphasize the sheer endless scale of space itself. The infographic not only teaches, entertains, and excites young minds, but also encourages children to think deeper about space and the universe, and learn more about it.

Their purpose is to study public engagement with different types of visualizations, using fisheries data. The topics selected for the visualizations, were chosen according to how relevant they were at the moment. Some topics were discarded because they did not fulfill all the requirements. Several topics had already been visualized, so they were not used. Others were not utilized because the data was not available or complete. Other topics were rejected, because the data was not sufficient to make the visualizations interactive. Finally they were selected according to how relevant they were to the project’s partners. Each visualization was created in different interactivity levels. The data generated will be used to determine which level is more likely to engage the viewer. These visualizations will also be presented in an Aquarium, to study viewers behavior in a public setting.

D’Huy’s work explores how myths change in the retelling down through the generations, and analyzes how those incremental changes can shed light on the history of human migration going as far back as the Paleolithic. (See his Scientific American article “Scientists Trace Society’s Myths to Primordial Origins”). To examine how myths vary across culture and time, the author maps the stories’ minimal narrative units — called mythemes —as if they were genes in a DNA sequence and uses them to reconstruct the genealogy and migrations of the different populations that share stories about constellations. Accurat designed a visualization of these narrative units in order to visually represent the different versions of the myths and the common elements across cultures.

We had to use a scraper to take all the speech copy off the website and then manually edit it to add spaces and remove html characters. We then manually tagged every speech to add meta data, for example if an actress thanked ""Irene"", we would find out who Irene was and tag the mention as an agent or sister or friend etc. Once all the tagging was done, we analysed the data for patterns and frequencies and plotted it into our infographic.

If, instead, you drill down and look at how the data is recorded at individual monitoring stations across all 50 states, we see a far more worrisome trend emerge, namely a marked increase in record-high temperature levels over the last few decades.

These challenges include growing and aging populations, safety and the environment. The Future Transport Regional Challenges project is an interactive dashboard with insightful animated visualisations for key issues in the state of New South Wales in Australia, which includes the city of Sydney. Each animation is specific for the selected region, providing meaningful observations from an otherwise inaccessible set of data. The animated maps show population changes over time, increases in congestion, and where people travel: using flyovers, transitions, and narration to hone in on insights. Using video rather than an interactive tool allows the story to be told more directly and helps shareability on social media so audiences don't have to navigate a large website. An interactive map of regions and key locations was also designed and developed to help audiences navigate the different regional dashboards. The map solved the issue of representing different sized regions, mixing it with point-based locations, and providing an accessible list view. This project is particularly unique as the data visualisation videos were made using web technology software like Mapbox and JavaScript, rather than video production software. This approach allowed us to make quick updates to both data and content during the review process. Creating videos with web technology also created time and cost savings by allowing the same script to be applied to different regional videos by simply changing the underlying data and customising the annotations.

2977	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2206-uncowlify-beef-the-environment	Uncowlify: Beef & The Environment.	Atul Kumar, National Institute of Design	This data visualisation is part of my project which is an awareness campaign on the environmental effects of food consumption, especially beef, which is one of the most inefficient forms of food. Beef causes the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions whilst also being one of the most resource consuming food sources. The idea is to give an overall view of the impact of beef consumption on the world carbon footprint as compared to other types of meat (excluding seafood due to lack of available and reliable data at the time of this project). The main sources of information were two reports by the United Nations ‘Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock’ and ‘Livestock’s Long Shadow’, and another by Word Bank ‘Livestock and Climate Change’. Other resources were CIWF, PETA, New-Harvest, One Green Planet, The Guardian, BBC and few other web articles. The trigger behind this project was a brief mention in the National Geographic documentary ‘Before the Flood’ - I decided to investigate their quote - “Beef is the most inefficient form of food.” An awareness campaign was designed around the theme of making people aware about the facts about their food choices and the visual mood was chosen to be abstract, colourful and positive in order to remove any connotations or notions related to beef as a food in different cultures and context, and to just focus on the empirical impacts of beef consumption as factual insights. The theme was kept positive and colourful to promote the idea that a change in the eating habit can have positive impact on the environment and health, and people should be encouraged towards this change. For the same a range of posters, and merchandise were created along with an informative infographic and an interactive data visualisation.

Some ways that are typically used to visualize this data include a stacked area chart, stacked bar chart, or line chart with a line for each category. However, there are disadvantages to using these approaches. In a stacked area chart and stacked bar chart, the changing position of the upper and lower bounds make it difficult to determine if the percent of total increases or decreases over time for categories in the middle. Using a line chart with a line for each category, the lines may overlap and result in overcrowding of categories that have a similar percent of total. To solve for these issues, I created a new chart type using D3.js that combines many area charts, hence the name Polyarea chart."

You should have heard about them, or you may be regarded as out of date. Korean pop culture, known as K-pop, is a genre of popular music originating in South Korea. It started in the early 90s, developed different kinds of styles, and is now a big trend. K-pop has become increasingly visible to global audiences, and thousands of fans all over the world are crazy about their idols. For example, the famous artists Psy and BTS. In 2012, Psy and Gangnam Style swept across the world. The official videos of Gangnam Style on YouTube had well over three billion views, the largest number of hits of any video at that time. It shows a big step of K-pop from Korea to the world. Then, the success of BTS pushed the K-pop to the next level.

3020	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/398-paper-cuts-interactive-visualization	Paper Cuts interactive visualization	Bill Schulz, Lou Saldivar, John Schmid	Many of the defining forces of our time â€” the rise of the digital age, the globalization of the economy, the decline of American competitiveness â€” can be understood through one simple thing: a sheet of paper. If that paper came from Wisconsin, the nation's top papermaking state, it is the product of a tight, local economy that has supported families and sustained communities for 150 years. The industry was built on the state's lush forests and rushing rivers, on the pride of fine craftsmanship and the power of constant innovation. Wisconsin mills launched the mass production of glossy paper and with it the rise of magazines. They created carbonless paper, pioneered strides in recycling, established the practice of renewable forestry. For generations, they produced paper for Bibles, best sellers. That led to a powerful sister industry â€” commercial printing â€” and the spinoff of household products, from Kleenex to disposable diapers. But that sheet of paper may no longer be from Wisconsin â€” or even the United States. It is now possible to cut down a tree in a Wisconsin forest, ship the pulp 3,000 miles around the world to China and watch it come back as high-quality paper that costs less than paper produced in the local mill. How can that be? That simple question drove the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's “Paper Cuts” series, a masterful, multimedia look at the effect of global economics on one of the state's cornerstone industries. In print and online, through penetrating stories, stunning photos, compelling videos and innovative graphics, a team of journalists provided readers with an unprecedented look at how the paper industry, already battling the threat of computers and iPads, now faces a more potent one from a country with a severe shortage of trees. The project took readers to the forests of northern Wisconsin to the boardrooms of New York hedge funds. And it took readers â€” for the first time â€” inside China's relentless drive to become the world's biggest paper power. After tripling production over the last decade, China has surpassed U.S. production and can now match the annual output of all of Wisconsin's mills in the span of three weeks. Reporter John Schmid and photojournalist Mike De Sisti traveled to China with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit that funds foreign travel to help journalists tell untold stories. The narrative lays bare the competitive position of the United States in a stark and revealing way. The “Paper Cuts” project is especially noteworthy for its cross-platform approach, one that is a model for today's multimedia journalism. The team â€” including interactive designer Emily Yount, graphic artist Lou Saldivar and designer Nick Lujero â€” told each piece of the story in the manner best suited for doing so, without forcing them into conventional, print-driven formats. A look at the distorted economic loop became a motion graphic. The history of the industry became an interactive map, connecting local changes to global trends. The print vs. digital comparison became an online carbon calculator.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Interactive Visualization

Here is a selection of the 21 infographics. Formula One in the concert hall (Cover): What kinds of physical stresses are conductors and musicians subjected to during a concert? To answer this question, on March 21 2014, four symphony orchestra musicians and conductor Daniel Harding were fitted with long-term ECG devices to monitor their heart rates during a concert. The program featured Henry Purcell’s »Funeral Music of Queen Mary« and Gustav Mahler’s sixth symphony. Preliminary results show that especially Daniel Harding performed at peak capacity. A detailed evaluation is not yet available butone conclusion can already be drawn: the stress situation of a musician is comparable to that of a professional athlete or Formula One pilot. Under Your Skin (p. 4): Scientists aren’t quite sure how a concert experience can get, in the truest sense, »under your skin«. Some of the factors that play a role in the development of goose bumps have, however, been identified. A mix of music characteristics, hearing situation and individual personality traits, which is different from person to person, contributes to this phenomenon. Instruments that are similar to the human voice (violin, oboe) most easily elicit goose bumps. Mariss Jansons (p. 8): The card shows biographical information and the professional stations of chief conductor Mariss Jansons. Composers Works, which Mariss Jansons has conducted with the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks in concerts since 2003. SYMPHONY OF AN ORCHESTRA’S WEEK (p. 68): The work phase displayed here (Verdi Requiem, October 2013) was a very busy but not atypical week with Mariss Jansons. It entailed rehearsals in three different Munich concert halls, two subscription concerts (Philharmonie), a charity concert (Prinzregententheater) and a trip to Vienna with two concerts (Musikverein). In the pictured score a bar represents a workday of 18 hours (hence a 18/4 time, a quarter note representing one hour of activity). Staves from top to bottom: (1) Instrument transport, stage set-up and loading, (2) rehearsals and concerts, (3) choir rehearsals and concerts (4) recording and broadcasting (TV, radio and internet stream) Children and Parents (p. 86): Is musical talent an inherited trait? Our analysis strongly suggests that love of music is passed on from parents to their children. One hundred musicians in the orchestra have a total of 171 children. The diagram shows the musical activities of the musicians’ parents and children. A few results: only 16% of the children do not play an instrument. 21% of the musicians’ mothers and 39% of their fathers are – or were – professional musicians. In 16% of the cases, both parents were active musicians. Only 18% of the musicians had parents who didn’t play an instrument.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2015	Longlist;Dataviz Project

Arranz tells the visual story of how the acceptance of silver as a common currency arose when Spanish navigators in the Philippines established a circular shipping route, known as the tornaviaje, between Asia and the Americas. More than 250 years of uninterrupted trade ensued between Asia and the rest of the world. The ships playing this route were known as China Ships. Chapter one, ‘the discovery of the roundtrip and the beginning of globalisation’ explores the origin of the route the Spanish established to the Philippine islands which opened trade with China. The routes and navigation charts pepper this chapter illustrating the first expedition to circumnavigate the world and the discovery of the Kuroshio current which led to the return voyage to the Americas and consequently the establishment of a global trade route.

3033	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2470-the-colour-of-disease	The colour of disease	7.4 Limited	Online images are an important resource for understanding medical conditions and their impact on those affected. The images of disease available online are dominated by visible effects on the human body, imaging and diagnosis techniques, transmission vectors, media coverage, awareness campaigns, and cultural and psychological associations. These factors influence the colours present in images of disease, and colour plays an important role in our perception of and emotional response to images and their subject matter. To investigate the association between colour and disease, we analysed the colour palette for 100 conditions based on the images available online. Some conditions are dominated by the colours of strong awareness campaigns: breast cancer is pink, prostate cancer is blue, and mitochondrial disease is green. Multiple images of blood cells make conditions like haemophilia and sickle cell anaemia red, while conditions like chicken pox and measles are dominated by flesh tones. And of course, scarlet fever is red and yellow fever is yellow. Polio is almost completely monochrome due to the number of black and white images predating the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the 1950s. Diagnostic images for ophthalmologic conditions like glaucoma and macular degeneration are typically orange, while MRI scans used to diagnose adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) are predominantly black and white. Cultural and psychological associations also seem to be important, especially for mental health conditions: depression is black and blue, while anxiety is dark with multi-coloured flashes. The visuals presented here show the subtle way in which colour in the environment can infiltrate our subconscious and influence our individual perceptions of these conditions. Methods: For each condition, we retrieved the first 100 images from a Google search (July 2017). Image size and shape were standardized and the images were combined. The pixels of the combined image were sorted by colour intensity (RGB values summed and divided by 3; https://github.com/fragmer/PixelSorter), and polar plots constructed using Adobe Photoshop.

The main vision in the form of visual chart directly reflects the relationship between visible and invisible groups. On November 9, 2016, a chaotic, scandal-ridden and fractious general election finally came to an end. Republican candidate Donald Trump swept away the decline in previous polls and won the 45th presidency of the United States with key victories in swing states like Florida and North Carolina. From the reversal of the results of the 2016 U.S. general election, we find that there are more silent and silent people in the noisy discourse circle. They have different opinions from the seemingly mainstream views, have great silent power, and may play a key role in important moments.

Depicted in strong visuals, one can easily see in one overview what the headlines are. It builds up from main figures, like total employment in the Dutch health care, to more detailed questions about (a.o.) trends, satisfaction, absenteeism and level of education. The viewer understands in just a glimpse the status of the workforce in the elderly care. This infographic does not only show static pictures, as one scrolls down the page the dynamics make this infographic more lively. The simplicity of the colors, matching the ActiZ theme won’t exhaust the viewer’s eyes. The infographic is published on the Actiz webpage, so it is publicly available. This way it provides transparency around the current situation in the Netherlands in the area of employment in elderly care. By providing transparency, it helps creating awareness for this industry which is highly in demand due to ageing of the Dutch population. The ageing of the population is also reflected in the trend figures. To illustrate, a trend of unbalanced growth in the workforce of this industry is shown. Another main trend the figures illustrate, is that the demand for higher educated personnel has increased. This asks for attention from the government to make sure these trends are governed well.

Where do new music styles come from? A.Track.Tion is a data visualisation aimed at shedding light on these deep and interesting questions. The core dataset is the Whitburn Project list, a collective effort to gather historical weekly music sales rankings published by the Billboard company. The subset we used (after cleaning of the original) contains 33560 songs. In order to explore the popularity of music, we had to expand the data in two ways: We collected genre information of the songs from Wikipedia, and we computed an estimate of the percentage of total sales associated with a given ranking position held for a week. We coupled our new datasets with estimates of global music sales, resulting in our final visualisation of popularity of music genres and subgenres. The genres extracted from Wikipedia contained information about which styles influenced which others. When we visualised this influence graph, our naive expectation of a ""tree of music"" styles was quickly shattered, resulting in a complex and organic-like tangled mess of relationships. We also coupled the influence graph to the popularity data, answering the question of wether the most popular is also the most influential."

I was diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism and Graves Disease in 2003, had a Radioactive Iodine therapy in 2006, and then switched to Hypothyroidism in 2009. I found this visualization a very personal experience, so I decided to do it by hand, paper-cutting, gluing, and writing. At first it was pleasant and unpleasant to recall all those years but I think the volunteer effort working on them and dealing with aesthetics using my hands led me to a friendship with the past; kind of getting tranquillity with dataviz. ----- Years and months are shown both in the Iranian Calendar and the Gregorian Calendar. Horizontal lines are years and the leaves show TSH lab results. Size and color shows value and being inside or outside of the normal ranges. Tiny dots show the pills I was using during my therapy, Methimazol for hyperthyroidism, Propranolol for irregular heart beat, Levothyroixin for hypothyroidism, and Pred Forte was used to weaken the immune system as Graves Disorder is an autoimmune disorder and it leads to pressure on the muscles around the eyes and makes the eyes protrude. The dragonal shape is for the occurrence of any other abnormal test results such as T4 RIA, T3 RIA, FTI, Anti TPO, T3 Uptake. --------- As a friendly text to anybody who reads this: I believe losing the inner peace and having worries, stress, and sadness is what you should omit from your life, and for me I think the start was because of two deaths and not accepting them. I asked my other friends and they also had some emotional experiences that led to their hyperthyroidism. A year after my RAI, I read a wonderful free ebook by Svetla Bankova which was about making balance in your life. I suggest you to read it and always find a way to make a peaceful relationship with any experience that you have not control over it, or in other cases do some action for that, and don't just hold it in your mind.

Charts and big numbers can be off-putting for the casual viewer so the challenge was to convey the story in an appealing and engaging way. TV designers worked with journalist Ian Rose to tell the story using motion graphics. The video feature was published on line and broadcast on BBC World.

It’s become a running joke and a warning that fans give to new viewers: don’t get too attached to any character, because they’ll probably get axed. Or poisoned. Or stabbed. Or pushed into an abyss. You get the idea. Seasons will typically wrap up with at least one major death (or massacre) in either the finale or one of the later episodes–y’know, just to leave viewers feeling good. The point is, there is a lot of murdering and double-crossing in Game of Thrones, and it’s generally in a character’s grab for power. Betrayals between allies are a regular day occurrence in Westeros. We decided to take a closer look at these acts of betrayal. We wanted to see: who double-crosses who? Which characters gain the most from their acts of treachery? Who rises in power and who falls? What were the relationships between the betrayers and the betrayed? What were their motives? Was it for power, love, revenge, money? 	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Longlist;Arts, Entertainment & Culture

The average grand finalist has certainly changed a lot over the years. ‘Mullets, moustaches and short shorts’ takes a light-hearted look at these changes in a fun, interactive and accessible way. We’ve created a set of average ‘every-players’ from the 50’s to now highlighting changes to height, weight, muscle-tone and perhaps most importantly, shorts-length and hairstyle. For a bit of fun, we’ve also illustrated the average weather on grand final days during that decade. The artwork is clean and bright and functions not only as an attractive feature illustration but also as an interactive graphic supporting the data used to tell the story in the subsequent article. Simple, unobtrusive animations provide atmosphere without muddying the function of the artwork as a comparative graphic. Putting the needs of our digital audience first, the presentation works beautifully on all device types including on mobiles. The artwork provided great material for social media at a time when the 2015 finals were about to start and interest was strong.

This 28 year hiatus coincides with the end of the state-sponsored doping program in East Germany in 1989 and the introduction of randomised drug testing globally in 1990. This empty space raises serious questions about the legitimacy of these records and makes a strong case for resetting them. What about the data for male athletics? Well, in the 28 years since the introduction of randomised drug testing, men have broken records 32 times in the corresponding events! Whilst anabolic steroids have increased performance amongst male athletes and numerous doping offences have been uncovered, the lack of baseline testosterone in women appears to result in greater incremental benefits from taking these drugs.

Nine years ago NASA set out to change all that, when the space probe New Horizons blasted off on a mission to explore the far reaches of the solar system, including a flight past Pluto. We built an interactive slider showing images of Pluto taken by New Horizons as it made its approach; then used images and long-form text to explain the background to the mission and why it mattered. As each new image was relayed back to Earth, it was updated to the slider, allowing readers to follow the story as Pluto came into focus. We allowed audience members to subscribe via email to receive a notification every time new imagery was released - and thousands did. The story became one of the most popular ABC News stories of the year, and was shared 20,000 times on social media, giving tens of thousands of people new insights into science and our solar system.

These acts include violence, terrorism, armed conflict and other efforts to stop a religious group from growing or operating. Given the importance of this topic to billions of people, this year the Center created an interactive digital essay to surface that body of research and highlight key global trends. The essay is aimed at a broad audience and designed to engage readers by maximizing the visual experience, without sacrificing the topic’s complexity and nuance. “A closer look at changing restrictions on religion” combines photography, written narrative, and cutting-edge data visualization to show how restrictions have evolved in the world’s 25 most populous countries. At the end of the essay, readers can explore 10 years of demographic, geographic and longitudinal data collected from nearly 200 countries. Underpinning the design language of the essay is the simple square, or “sprite.” While scrolling through the narrative, 18,000 squares reassemble to depict different facets of the multivariate dataset, such as cartograms, scatterplots and small multiples. Advanced browser programming and WebGL drive the fluid permutations of each sprite. We live in an era where audiences are bombarded with information, where competition for public attention has exploded, politically motivated mis- and disinformation is on the rise, and complex issues are oversimplified to accommodate the shrinking attention span of news consumers. At the same time, this era has seen unprecedented availability and access to data. Data visualization allows us to explore and make sense of the world in ways that weren’t possible even just a few decades ago.

These homicides are considered legal, and the offender faces no punishment or criminal sanction. Our story was a deep dive into more than four decades of FBI homicides data to explore how often and in what circumstances killings are considered justified. We told this data-driven story visually to clearly show readers the role that deeply embedded racial bias plays in whether a killing is determined to be justifiable.

Apple Fanboys, Android Fanboys, Playstation Fanboys, Xbox Fanboys… the web is awash with people flaming each other about their choice of technology. If there's one thing they do agree on however it's that the time of Internet Explorer is over. Hail the King. Hail Google Chrome. In many parts of the world however, ol' IE is very much alive and kicking and some of the reasons why are nearly as surprising. South Korea for example is for nearly all intents and purposes tied to IE. Why? In the late 90s the South Korean government developed its own platform to promote secure e-commerce – a prescient move. However the technology they used to develop this platform only works on Windows based machines with ActiveX. While these restrictions have since been rolled back, this has resulted in a continued domination of IE nearly 20 years later. Globally however, the big reason is staying power of Windows XP and its default browser – Internet Explorer. Recent figures suggest that more than 35% of all PCs are still using XP nearly a decade later. Hand the crown back Chrome, there may be a way to go yet. MyToshiba have recently compiled this browser share overview as part of their Leading Innovations series to show the disparity in browser share globally.

It focuses on solving quantitatively visualizing the spatial distribution of many points under different categories especially when these points partially overlap with each other. This PhoenixMap system can successfully help us understand the change and patterns of birds’ regions over many years. By smoothing the distribution curves, the graphical perception helps users understand the spatial and temporal relationships numerically. This showcase is designed for visualizing the given birds’ data includes 19 different types, and the temporal activity records over the past 30 years according to their geo-locations. Backtracking their actions allow the users to understand birds local migrating trends and number changes. A map-based on geolocation is required to express details information. There are two explicit classifications for the data. The first one is tracing on the timeline, while the other is the types of the birds. However, how to deal with the overlapping records (dots in the graph) turns out to be a significant issue. Even though the current pervasive visualization methods recommend enough tendency displaying for spatiotemporal tasks, the lack of quantification is still required to be tackled vigorously. We introduce a new visualization approach which is able to quantify the discrete data to be visually continuous. We designed an innovative way to use enclosed curves with varies width to represent regions of points in different years or. We first computed the concave boundaries of a set of points, then compute the width of segments based on the density distribution facing the portion. Segments are finally smoothed to generate a smooth contour of these points. We can overlap many distribution contours together. The smooth continuous shapes with different colors can help us quickly see the change in distributions over the years. Using the bird call collection and the included map of the Wildlife Preserve, we characterized the patterns of all of the bird species in the Preserve over the time of the group. The system shows that it is clear that two significant contributing signs of a decrease in local bird populations are the yearly locational change of the population and the concentration of the population. If there are enough resources and space, a population would not need to expand. As a result, there would be a relatively stable population of birds in the area. On the other hand, a closely clumped population, known as clumped dispersion, is caused by limited resources and an uneven resource distribution, which could lead to smaller, decreasing bird populations. The conventional methods cause the cognitive overload that influences the user exploration experience by delaying the expected quickness and directness. By our presented PhoenixMap, the comparison of spatiotemporal aggregates can address the quick and direct visual analytics across the graphical results across multi-scenes. Each scene displays the status of the cluster distribution. It will contribute to many geographical and spatial distribution visualization taks.

We are a qualitative research startup based out of Johannesburg, South Africa. We live in a continent that places so much importance on passing information and stories through the oral tradition. Because of this, we have always believed in the power of qualitative methodologies to bring to life the diverse populations, religions, languages and belief systems across more than 50 countries. As a startup, we were always frustrated in ourselves by following the tradition of delivering 100+ page powerpoints to clients, which were rarely shared internally, and got lost in our clients’ file directories. We decided we needed to tell our stories differently, so brought on Anja, who is a trained graphic designer that wanted to break into research and strategy (lucky us!). This work in particular, was the summary findings for one of our clients, from our flagship product, Sense Check. The methodology includes using creative professionals to help develop, audit, and provide feedback to brands during the very early stages of their campaign development. Because verbatims from professionals tend to be very rich in substance, we always like to bring those to the forefront. However, Anja also wanted to surface some of the main findings that the panel had identified, without the client needing to browse through 100 pages of raw text or ugly crosstabs. Anja’s use of color tones, and literally “out of the lines” graphics also reflect our relationship with our panel of over 100k creative professionals. We always try to strike a balance between serving our clients (like Unilever, L’Oreal, GSK, and Barclay’s) while remaining engaging (if not hip) to our creative professionals. The end result, is a unique personality that tends to warm up the room when we present our findings to the client. We were motivated to try this presentation style out on this particular project because the client did not have an in-house researcher who could sift through the powerpoint to find the main insights. Because this visual was so clearly articulating the strengths and weaknesses of the campaign (and is pretty stimulating visually), the client was able to immediately digest and then implement the suggestions. They have become one of our biggest clients to date. Anja had very little research experience when she started with delvv.io, but is now managing accounts and projects for clients like Unilever, General Motors, GSK in challenging markets like Northern Nigeria, Ethiopia, India and Japan. She believes that there is more room to incorporate infographics, visual charts and even storyboards to communicate with clients and our creative community alike.

The old adage, –Work smarter, not harder' doesn't seem to apply as you work after hours, through lunch, and even on the weekends just to keep you head above water. Seriously, where does all the time go?! More than 21,000 companies of all sizes use Atlassian issue tracking, collaboration, and software development products to work faster and smarter, together and waste less time at work.

I’ve been a fan of the TV series since I was old enough to watch them on VHS with my brothers and I now know most of the episodes by heart. I collected all sorts of data from the 236 episodes, from the trips the friends took, to their different love interests and the various aspects of their lives. From this data collected I created three infographic posters - each with a different topic - to help visualize the intricacies of the show and the singularities of the six main characters.

It was created to educate US-based health-care providers (HCPs) in the field of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. IPF is a degenerative disease in which lung tissue becomes scarred, reducing lung function. It is often fatal. Complex information was presented in a highly visual, interactive manner with audio/video clips. Audio patient-voices with “revealing” words gave a personal feel to the activity. This was a novel educational format for HCPs and so we took great care in including “how to use” information and instructions through the interactive infographic.

Each of the 12 themes is further divided into artistic subcategories. The size of the area of each category reflects the number of artworks on that theme. To transport the reader to a Picassian dimension, the infographic was created with the recurring techniques, shapes and colors originally used by the artist in his work.

Economic Times	The past few years have seen a steady increase in the number of multiplex screens in India. Apart from the mainstream big-budget movies, Bollywood has been evolving and producing experimental films in different genres, in response to the demands of multiplex audiences. Between July 2016 and July 2017, around 116 films were released in Bollywood across 14 different genres. While some fared poorly at the box office, a few managed to outshine the competition. Here we look at the genres that charmed the audience and set the cash registers ringing. If we look at the box-office numbers closely, it's clear that the year belonged to fantasy. SS Rajamouli's magnum opus 'Baahubali' laughed all the way to the bank, minting over Rs. 350 crores in 11 weeks. In sports, the Aamir Khan-starrer 'Dangal', the second on the list, clocked Rs. 194.21 crores. This was higher than the combined net collection of Rs. 162.02 crores for 22 films across genres like Action and Comedy. Bollywood's love for love stories continued through the year. Amongst the 21 films released in the Romance genre, 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania' was the most successful movie with the highest audience turnout. While Crime pipped Action when it came to selling tickets, Horror and Thriller films failed to thrill the box-office. About creator:- Hemal Sheth I am a Data + Visual artist.

The work tries to match the behavior data with the brain wave figure by the data capture of the experimenter's behavior. Finally, the experimenter pushes the funnel which is set by the program. The figure is the visualization of the data of the emotional brain wave. In the course of the experiment, the brain waves of different people and similar emotions are found to be similar. The work seeks to build a bridge between strangers through the similar figures of strangers, and to explore the possibility that the emotional expression of strangers can draw closer to each other through visual means.

These men, women, and children were fleeing conflict and instability in Africa and the Middle East. My artistic decisions were driven by the question, “How can a map show the sheer number of victims in such a tragedy without abstracting the uniqueness of each individual? Assigning a unique dot to each victim helped to portray the unsettling number of recorded losses. I placed red dot symbols on the map, one by one, based on the location information of each accident. The lack of a distinct geometry behind the configuration of these islands of victims humanizes them and highlights their position suspended between their places of origin and planned destinations. By flattening destination countries into black coastlines, the map illustrates what victims were waiting to see on the horizon. Distance and location are far from exact, but a wider portrayal of the Mediterranean Sea is closer to victims’ experience of the journey, as they navigated in unseaworthy vessels, often using only hand-held compasses. Individual lines of blue text waving away from some of the clusters of victims relate the details of who died, how, and where they were going. And they leave us wondering: What about the stories behind all the other. Explore a higher resolution of this map on this page.

3255	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3875-visualising-fairytales	Visualising Fairytales	Muskeen Liddar	I produced a series of posters illustrating the narratives of well-recognised fairytales: “The Three Little Pigs”, “Cinderella” and “Goldilocks and The Three Bears.” I have visualised these narratives through the use of shape colour and typography. I explored these narratives by mapping each letter from the story to a coloured square. I then explored the similarity and variation within the colour patterns that I have created. I decided to explore these stories because they were familiar from my childhood, and I was interested in how I could visually engage with them at a different point in my life (age 18). The fact that the stories are well known, further allowed me to offer a unique perspective and convey the narrative more ambiguously. I further felt that these stories were interesting to explore, because of the repetitive language and story structure. I was intrigued by how I could visually show these language patterns through colour and additionally decided to show similarity by representing all vowels as the colour yellow. I created these pieces using the programming software ‘NodeBox’ to create an algorithm which mapped the colour values in my key to each letter. I then exported this to Adobe Illustrator where I worked on my poster layout and design aspects. One of my influences was ideas of blackout poetry, and how a narrative can be conveyed through blacking out details and focusing on particular/selective words. I aimed to interpret this in my work by selecting keywords in the narrative which were written rather than represented through squares (blocked out) Through creating these posters, I realised the different language patterns and how I could apply them to create visual drama and unravel the narratives in unique ways. I found it interesting to visually present the patterns I found in the text, and interpret the language in a visual way.

Adding tin or lead alloy to pure copper has special importance and historical significance. Bronze is found all over the world especially as a symbol of world civilization. It is an artifact made by the ancients using a very special process, the most famous of which is one of its casting methods, called the Fan Casting. Fan Casting, also known as die-casting, first molds with mud, sculpts various patterns and inscriptions, and then burns them to make them into master molds, and then molds them with mother molds. Melting the alloy, pouring the alloy into the pottery cavity of the pottery vane cavity, after being removed from the vane, after being cleaned and polished, it is the finished bronze product. After investigation, I divided the production process into five parts: production model, system, baking, pouring, and scraping. I hereby introduce the production process and hope to pass on it.

The video was produced by the largest news organisation in the Netherlands, NOS. It came about with the help of Dutch student Thomas van Linge (22), who keeps track of territorial shifts within this conflict in the Middle East.  Ever since he was 17, in 2014, Thomas has been mapping the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, sometimes being only a few dozen meters off, in his estimation. He's able to do this through his extended online network in both Iraq and Syria. He displays the results of his efforts in the simplest way possible: in Microsoft Paint.  NOS op 3, an innovative department within the NOS, joined forces with him to help him reach a broader audience with his extraordinary work. The result is this animated video, which shows how the caliphate expanded from a small area around stronghold Raqqa, to the biggest area a terrorist group has ever laid hands on.  To clarify the implications of IS losing ground, large terrorist attacks in the West have been included. The video was published the day the Iraqi Secretary of Defence announced his army had reclaimed Mosul from the Islamic State terrorists. NOS op 3 is part of the NOS, the Dutch public news broadcaster, with the mission to make news for an audience between 20 and 35 years.

3276	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3081-living-map	Living Map	Sigitas Guzauskas	Climate change is a very hot topic nowadays. We are facing extreme weather events more and more frequently. Unusual temperatures, excess rainfall or extremely strong winds, forest fires disrupt our habitual life. In the situation like a natural question arises - “What is the future of our living environment?” If we continue our way of life will our environment be habitable at all? Or will we need to migrate to other territories? To visualize a possible scenario of a climate change an interactive LIVING MAP was designed. The LIVING MAP visualizes the change of summertime rainfall in Europe. The rainfall data was chosen because precipitation plays a vital role in all human-environment: agriculture, water supply, energy production, tourism and natural ecosystems.  A precipitation data comes from the European Environmental Agency. The data was derived using climate simulation model. It compares summer precipitation in the period 1971-2000 and 2071-2100. The simulation of climate change shows that a southern part of the continent will receive almost 40% less rainfall and the northern part will receive approx. 30% more precipitation. It means an amount of summertime precipitation will change our habitable environment dramatically. Usually, data visualization reduces any natural phenomena to basic geometric shapes, points and lines. Because of such an extreme schematization, we see any data visualization as “boring” or “lifeless”. Opposite a LIVING MAP project, tries to represent the phenomena in more impactful, memorable and attractive way. The map is a physical materialization of quantitative data. So, it could be perceived not observing basic geometric primitives but experienced by the much wider spectrum of perception. The map could be touched, smelled, looked around, pictured, meditated etc. The map changes all the time so it looks different any period. I believe that this kind of data representations could pay audience attention to a discourse of climate change more effectively.  For a LIVING MAP data visualization, a local ecosystem was designed. A species of alive fire moss (Ceratondon purpureus) were plated onto a special surface. This type of moss can visually indicate the presence or absence of the water. If the moss receives enough water then it turns green. If it lacks water it turns brown or yellow. Excess of humidity makes the moss almost black. The controlled amount of water was supplied for a moss map. An amount of water correlates with digital data. Different areas of the map received a different quantity of water. In a few months, a special moss pattern on the surface of the map was created. It metaphorically represents the possible environmental scenario in the European continent in 2070.

It is the first time that so many handsigns have been assembled and redesigned into one same style.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Longlist;Data visualization

And how can you show people the benefits? These were the questions that West Sussex County Council wanted us to show in an innovative campaign entitled Think before you throw.  Starting point for Real World Visuals was a giant spreadsheet with several years of data on the actual waste that West Sussex residents were recycling, and more importantly what was still being discarded in the general waste bins. So we extracted the raw data, calculated the volumes and designed and created a video, GIF, video extract films and a range of still and print materials to illustrate the actual volumes of waste that could be recycled by households. The film and other comms material focused on the central £3 million saving that could be made if more waste was diverted from landfill. Visuals shows the 32,000 tonnes of material wasted each year that could be recycled on a Council-wide as well as house-hold level. The film and images use Real World Visuals acclaimed ‘concrete visualisation’ techniques first pioneered by Carbon Visuals, the predecessor company.

Empowerment relies on annual data to track the issues that matter most. The United Nations has defined a set of 52 indicators essential to telling the story of women’s empowerment. This is by far the largest, most comprehensive set of gender indicators ever assembled. However, more than half of the indicators average less than one data point per country from 1990 to 2013.

As air pollution attracts more attention, fireworks became a target of criticism because they produce smoke and hazardous gases like sulfur dioxide. Hence, banning fireworks has become a common practice for the 50 most populated cities in China.  To identify what impact fireworks have on air quality, we drew out the polar/bar charts, mimicking the shape of firework displays. Each bar represents one city. The higher the bar, the larger the hourly mass of PM2.5 concentration. Each line of the polar charts represents each hour of the 24 hours of New Year's Day. The longer the line, the higher the values of PM2.5 concentration.  We also tailored the visualization for different platforms.  For the mobile version, the data is demonstrated in a side-by-side format. Municipalities are arranged by policy types since that's the key variable for our storytelling.  For the PC interactive version and poster version, we maximize the capacity of the larger screen. We arranged municipalities horizontally, and the readers can see all 50 municipalities' data at a glimpse. They were first categorized by policy types. The readers can play with it, including showing comparisons between 2017 and 2018, regrouping the data by air quality rankings, etc.  PC interactive version: http://image.thepaper.cn/html/zt/2019/02/fireworks/index.html Poster version: http://projects.thepaper.cn/thepaper-cases/839studio/yh_full.jpg	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Shortlist;Longlist;News & Current Affairs

How does urbanisation effect biodiversity? Imagine you're standing in the centre of a very large city, complete with roads, skyscrapers, traffic noise and pollution. How much wildlife do you see around you? How much biodiversity do you see? As cities grow, vital habitat is destroyed or fragments into patches not big enough to support complex ecosystems. This book looks into three cities where population growth has reached alarming levels. This was displayed through the use of pattern infographics, using pull out posters and playful risograph colours. I hope to improve attitudes and understanding of the ecology found in urban areas, if only in a small way.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Maps, Places & Spaces;Longlist

I underwent in-depth research into Booth's diaries that he kept. Looking into the archive compiled by LSE I was fascinated that the map was based on the individual streets and the people that live in street. I started to wonder what this map would look like today? I became intrigued by all the information I was finding. While looking into poverty today I came across a large range of statistics this I then compiled this into a large database and from this, the poverty index was created. The poverty index I created was made up of several factors from Infant mortality, Minimum wage, house prices etc. Data was taken from open data sources and trust from London. As I couldn't go to every street in London instead I broke them down into boroughs. I started with circles of data from population and then started to expand them according to the index I collected. The visual representation of the pieces is about highlighting and illuminating areas of London which are in poverty. The larger the heads of the nails and holes are the areas of higher poverty.

3339	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/369-venture-capital-investments-1995-2011	Venture Capital Investments: 1995-2011	Natesh Daniel	This data visualization is an exercise in creating a multivariate display using disparate but overlapping scales. Five variables are reported: quarter (of the year), total venture capital investments, total number of venture capital deals, total Internet-specific investments, and total number of Internet-specific deals. The scales for each variable (except time) do not relate but they follow a similar pattern. The metaphor for this design relates to the dot-com era bubble (represented by the colored Internet investment bubbles and the bubble-shaped scales) and its burst in the year 2000, which is literally represented by data bars bursting out of the circular scales and extending off the chart. The take-away from this visualization is that venture capital funding, though alive and well today, has never returned to the levels invested during the heyday of the dot-com boom. The beauty in this visualization lies in the circular time-scale and its dark feel, which calls attention to the brightly-colored Internet-specific bubbles. Though this graphic reports linear trend data, its manipulation into a circular shape is unusual and defies the notion that trend data must be aligned horizontally in order for comparisons to be made accurately. Comparisons in this visualization are not as important as the pattern that emerged. The visual representation may be enjoyed for its own sake.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013	Infographic

We constantly challenge conventional thinking for our clients, creating powerful solutions to remove complexity and deliver a wide variety of data visualisation tools. Over a relatively short period, our data solutions have evolved as one of the 4 core pillars of what we do here at Soak Digital, allowing us to work with internationally recognised brands using data visualisation and technology; making their data consumable, functional and always with aesthetics in mind. When Donald Trump became the 45th president of the USA, The London School of Economics (LSE) felt an understanding of trends in specific US states was needed to help predict future developments. Soak were asked to build the interactive aspects of the website – creating an apolitical, online resource portal- giving in-depth information for anyone interested in exploring the political landscape of America; with more than 2,500 pieces of data as provided by LSE. The achieved aim was to make the portal as user-friendly as possible, for those with no knowledge of US politics through to avid experts, journalists and commentators. Landing on the main page allows users access to a menu listing various policy areas from abortion to work and trade unions. Clicking on a policy area will highlight the states which have recent data updates in that region of the USA. Users can then access a profile of each state with easily surfaced, comprehensive stats and data on political make up, to policies ranging far and wide: cannabis, capital punishment, legislative and gubernatorial control and details, as well as recent and upcoming elections. Each state is colour-coded to show when there is unified government, i.e. when either the Democratic or Republican Parties hold the state’s Governorship, House and Senate. Red for Republican control, and blue for Democratic control. Mixed control is denoted by purple. Users can review past politics and policy updates from that state, organised by month, and policy-area keywords. Clicking on an individual state highlights the state and shows a pop-up dialog listing the most recent three politics and policy updates from that state (plus the source) Users can then click through to view the originating blog post or article if they so desire. These updates are also shareable via social media. Awarded with a prestigious 2019 Guardian University Award in the digital innovation category, the project has also been such a success with audiences globally, that it has become the blueprint for similar interactive resources ahead of the Indian elections in 2019 and a model for a future global electoral interactive overview being planned by the university’s government department. “Soak were fantastic partners for our State of the States project.

This fast growing industry also contributed to social inequality in urban China. --Newsworthiness: In mid 2014, the growth of China’s property market was slowing down. The PRC government responded promptly with a series of powerful boosting policies. It was also proposed that migrant workers in the nation to be the new demand driving force of the property sales in urban areas. The team therefore considered the topic’s newsworthiness and decided to work on a data-driven journalism project about the housing market. --Animated Interactive Map: The bars in the interactive map represent the cities’ property price. The map also serves as an animation to portray the month-by-month changes in prices throughout the decade. The users can choose a particular city in the map to see a more detailed line chart about that city. Related policies concerning the housing market also listed on the page. The map also shows the regional disparity of price that cities of eastern region have a higher property price than cities in the central and western regions. --Explanatory Journalism: An article is included in the project to explain to the users the history and transformation of China’s housing system, with graphs and infographic to further describe the trends and patterns. --Discovery through Data Visualization: On a heatmap, month-on-month changes in property price of each city are characterized in colours, with red grid representing a rise and blue grid representing a down according to the tradition of colour usage in China. When the data is structured, patterns are discovered. Through data visualization, it is discovered that it takes a longer time for the boosting policies to shore up the market in the 2014 slump than the previous ones. Findings are included in the page to facilitate understanding. --Engaging Users by Housing Affordability Calculator: Users can find out how many years does it take for them to buy a house in a particular city. The calculator also included the concept of income-to-price ratio to illustrate how hard it is for ordinary citizen to purchase an apartment. --Data Collection: Economic data is one of the very few datasets that are available in a usable format in China. The team therefore decided to make full use of it. And multiple data sources, both from the official publications and commercial research companies, were used. 70 cities are included in this project to represent and compare the situation of megacities and smaller cities. --Mobile Adaptation: For the mobile version (only in Chinese: http://datanews.caixin.com/mobile/home/), user’s location is detected by the system and the page will highlight the corresponding city. In China, mobile news reading is more predominant. On the mobile version, a message to encourage users to check the desktop version is attached.

3367	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1789-temperature-rising	Temperature Rising	Dean Farrell	Temperatures have been slowly rising for a number of years. In the charts below you can see that the late 19th and early 20th century were quite cool relative to the rest of the time period, 1880-2016. Temperatures on average continued to rise throughout the 20th century. Notice that there were fewer and fewer instances of below average temperatures. In fact, the last month the world saw below average temperatures was December 1984. Temperature increases really accelerated in the 21st century. December 2015 was the first time world temperatures were more than one degree Celsius or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit above average. This started a streak of five straight such months. If this doesn't sound like much, consider that such a rise in your body temperature would likely leave you quite sick.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Maps, Places & Spaces

The Atlas places the industrial capabilities and knowhow of a country at the heart of its growth prospects, where the diversity and complexity of existing capabilities heavily influence how growth happens. Developed at Harvard’s Center for International Development, the Atlas combines trade data with synthesized insights from CID’s research on Economic Complexity in a way that is accessible and interactive. As a dynamic resource, the tool is continually evolving with new data and features to help answer questions such as: What does a country import and export? How has its trade evolved over time? What are the drivers of export growth? Which new industries are likely to emerge or disappear in a given geography? Which are likely to disappear? What are the GDP growth prospects of a given country in the next 5-10 years, based on its productive capabilities? The original online Atlas was launched as a companion tool to the book, The Atlas of Economic Complexity: Mapping Paths to Prosperity. Since then, the online Atlas has been significantly enhanced with new features, refreshed visualizations and updated, more accurate datasets. Today, the Atlas is used worldwide by policymakers, investors, entrepreneurs, academics and the general public as an important resource for understanding a country’s economic structure.

A name soon caught her attention: ""Angela,"" among the first Africans brought to Virginia in 1619. Angela survived the first leg from Angola on a slave ship, was taken hostage by British pirates and eventually sold to the commander of Jamestown Island. Her age and the date of her death remain unknown. Smith, along with Deborah Barfield Berry, Kelley Benham French, Rick Hampson and Jarrad Henderson, spent months meticulously reporting and preparing our ambitious series. They were supported by dozens of USA TODAY colleagues – writers, editors, designers, producers, developers, visual specialists – who produced 1619: Searching for Answers, remembering the first enslaved Africans to be brought to the English-speaking colonies that became America. The challenge before the graphics desk was to research and communicate the scale of those directly affected by slavery in the lands that would become the United States.

A feature can be any kind of visual pattern such as a car in an image, a dot in a matrix, or a park in a map. Our technique visualizes such annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels by using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the patterns. Insets are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the outer boundary to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation. Annotated features are interactively clustered by their spatial distance and pattern type and are visually represented as an aggregated inset to provide scalable exploration within a single viewport. Exploring annotated patterns in context is often needed to assess the relevance of patterns and to dissect important from unimportant regions. For example, imagine trying to find a good location for your next ski trip. The details of a ski area and the connection between multiple ski areas is important to define the relevance of a region, but zooming in often leads to a lack of context and doesn't allow comparisons of different regions. Computational biologists have similar issues when studying thousands of small patterns in large genome interaction matrices to understand which physical interactions between regions on the genome are the driving factor behind the structure of the genome. In astronomy, researchers are exploring and comparing multiple heterogeneous galaxies and stars within super high-resolution imagery. In either case, inspecting every potentially relevant region in detail is simply not feasible because of the large size of the multiscale visualizations and the high number of annotated patterns. Exploring the visual details of these annotated patterns with insets requires a tradeoff between several conflicting criteria. Patterns must be visible for inspection and comparison (detail). Enough of the overview needs to be visible to provide context for the patterns (context). And the detailed pattern representation must be close to its actual position in the overview (locality). Scalable Insets support users in early exploration through multifocus guidance with dynamic and interactive placement and aggregation of insets. The entire design is focused on scalability and provides a dynamic tradeoff between details, context, and locality to keep the number of simultaneously displayed insets stable even in the presence of hundreds to thousands of annotated patterns.

From there, the road to Freising is not long - just three hours by car. However, considering the average age of its inhabitants, the distance could not be greater: 10,5 years separate the Thuringian town and the Bavarian district of one another. While in Suhl the population is aging and shrinking, the opposite takes place from 300 kilometers to the south. Young families flock from Munich to neighboring Freising, in order to find their luck in the countryside. These phenomena are explained by the rural exodus (especially from less-favored regions in the east), the urban exodus (from the expensive cities) and demographic change. Suhl was once synonymous in mining and gun making, now is weakening the economy, youth pulls away. In 2030 the average age in many land lines will be about as high as in Suhl today.

3421	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3058-queering-the-map	Queering The Map	Lucas LaRochelle	Queering the Map is a community generated counter-mapping project that locates queer moments, memories, and histories in relation to physical space. As queer life becomes increasingly less centered around specific neighborhoods and the buildings within them, notions of ‘queer space’ become more abstract and less tied to concrete geographical locations. The intent of Queering the Map is to collectively document the spaces that hold queer memory, from park benches to parking garages—to mark moments of queerness wherever they occur. The project intends to leave ‘queerness’ open to endless interpretation. From direct action activism to conversations expressing gender pronouns, from feelings of isolation to moments of rapturous love,Queering the Map functions as a living archive of queer experience. The mapping out of concrete queer histories is at the core of the project, and elders of the queer community are particularly encouraged to add moments and places of historical significance to the map in order to preserve our collective history—one that is always at risk of erasure. Through mapping these ephemeral moments, Queering the Map aims to create a web of queerness that shows the ways in which we as a community are intimately connected. In a moment of serious political turmoil, it is more pertinent than ever that minoritarian communities merge along lines of commonality, so that we may better resist the forces that work against us. By mapping out queer experience in all of its permutations, Queering the Map aims to commemorate the work we have done as a community, as well as make clear the work we still have left to do. By merging the subjective experience into the collective, Queering the Map works to create a feeling of solidarity across difference and across borders.

You can follow the sequence of places in their accounts by noting the number of each excerpt, generally from east (right) to west (left). The largest places, such as cities or concentration camps, are located according to their approximate actual location. Smaller places, such as barracks, woods, or rooms, are located based on their topological relationship to the other places mentioned in the interviews, such as places they were within or near. The legend explains the colors that signify each person’s account and the reasoning behind the map’s style and effects. If both survivors mention a place, it appears in both colors. This map was born of necessity. Conventional cartography and GIS use latitude and longitude to place objects in space. However, coordinates are often impossible to determine for small places or for historical places that have ambiguous or uncertain location. Because we wanted to include all places that seemed significant to Patipa and Brodman, we developed a hybrid approach that enables us to include the very small, intimate places (a building, a train car, a pocket) as well as towns, regions, and countries. In this way the map is a cartographic exploration of the spatiality of the Holocaust as well as our own responses to the accounts. The textual excerpts on the map either describe the quality of a place or an event that made it notable for the speaker. The texts do not constitute narratives, but we hope they give you a glimpse of two individuals’ experiences as the Holocaust tore them from their homes and carried them across Europe.

In these annual charts, we explore methods to visualize last year's weather. CLEVERÂ°FRANKE has a special affinity with the weather; the names CLEVER and FRANKE have been combined with the aid of the degree symbol. A reference to the astronomer Anders Celsius (CÂ°) and physicist Daniel Fahrenheit (FÂ°). This degree symbol served as the basis for the design of our visual identity: two researchers within the same field, found different approaches and references. Something definitely recognisable in the personalities of the founders of CLEVERÂ°FRANKE. For 2012 we focused on the relationship between weather data provided by the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) and the sentiments in social media about the weather. Is the way people rate the weather on the internet in accordance with the meteorological facts? To analyse this, we have used 714,843 messages concerning the weather in this chart. The messages were collected from a variety of websites, social media platforms and internetfora. This data was provided by Finchline, a company specialized in social media monitoring. Our weather chart of this year provides several interesting observations; sunshine is prominent in the way most people rate the weather. The correlation between sunshine and weather sentiment is stronger than the correlation between weather rating and sentiment. Overall, the Dutch weather is predominantly rated negatively (58%). Only in April and March people rated the weather mostly positive. Along with the increase in general use of social media in 2011, the amount of messages about the weather rose throughout this year. As the months passed, people rated the weather more negatively, especially in the month December.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2013

Why does this matter? For people living in the poorest parts of the world, access to the internet isn’t a luxury—it’s life-changing. ONE, a campaigning and advocacy organization, is currently rolling out several programs to address this digital gap. They asked FFunction to create an interactive data visualization that would highlight some key findings and contextualize them in an engaging, shareable way. As part of ONE’s larger Poverty is Sexist campaign that calls on communities, governments and private sectors around the world to help impoverished women within their countries, this site illustrates how access to the Internet and digital media can empower people in developing countries, especially women. Displayed on a single scrolling page, the site presents two main visualizations: one shows the current rate of Internet usage in African countries, and another further breaks down the first viz by gender to show the disparity between women and men who use the Internet in Africa and around the world. A form at the bottom of the page directs visitors to sign the Poverty is Sexist petition. FFunction's design team decided the best way to contextualize the data would be to contrast how the internet improves the quality of life in the wealthiest parts of the world, compared with the most poverty-stricken. For example, every month, over 560 billion text messages are sent worldwide. Of course, these can be useful for chatting with friends or receiving appointment reminders. But in sub saharan Africa, text messages can allow women who live far from a doctor to receive advice on how to have a safe and healthy pregnancy. Poverty is sexist—in so many ways, girls and women are hit harder and have fewer opportunities, and access to the internet is no different. Women in the poorest countries are almost a third less likely to have access to the Internet than men, and the gap is increasing. Visualizing this data and putting some context around it helps engaged citizens, journalists and policymakers to understand the problem in both broad strokes and granular detail, and—hopefully—take action.

Many Boomers are still trying to pinpoint how millennials approach life. They are trying to understand how to impress millennial colleagues, how to sell to them, or how to retain them as employees. Boomers want to know what it was like to grow up with today’s technology, and how that impacts one’s outlook. Even millennials are still perplexed by their own generation, including themselves. Just because there is a lot being written about Gen Y in the media does not mean that anyone really understands anything. In fact, many millennials are truly unique, and can’t really be meaningfully categorized in any black or white box. The reality is that millennials were not shaped by just three TV channels – their culture stems from access to millions of different websites and Youtube channels, unfiltered points of view, a wealth of diversity, and recent world events. And while we don’t want to put millennials in a box, we do like to focus on data. Take away your own conclusions from the following infographic.

This set of infographics for ACMI uses publicly available collection metadata to explore the allocation and lifespans of various media storage formats. ACMI’s collection aims to preserve film, yet formats such as 35mm and 16mm film are at risk of vinegar syndrome, a chemical reaction that degrades the quality of the film depending on temperature and humidity conditions. Magnetic tape formats such as VHS, U-Matic and Beta also degrades over time. In order to save the collection, the original films much be duplicated and digitised, yet this is a monumental task for a 40,000 strong collection. Furthermore, as technology advances, no one can predict what formats we will use in the future, or what hardware, software or file formats will be come obsolete. The narrative ‘the Mortality of Media’ is supported by additional research into the durability of various formats, provided by the National Film and Sound Archive, academic journals, the National Film Preservation Foundation (USA), the Image Permanence Institute and commercial media transfer services. Aesthetically, the infographics express the effects of time through gradients, with composition and shape taking precedence over traditional scientific graph formats, inviting the viewer to take a closer look. Inspired by the pink fade of vinegar syndrome, they also highlight the fuzzy, approximate nature of lifespan timelines with a gradual fadeout of colour.

China’s rapid development of high-speed railways have been very eye-catching in the recent decade. Six years after the 300 kph speed cap, the fastest train speed was increased back to 350 kilometers per hour – the world’s highest operating speed. To see the historical changes of speed, we turned to train timetables from 1949 (when P.R.China was founded) to 2017, and calculated the travel times between Beijing, China’s capital, and China’s provincial capitals. We use basically the same graph to show the travel times. However, in accordance to each point we make in the article, we highlight or group the lines differently for clarity. For example, we would highlight cities on Beijing-Guangzhou line and find that these cities’ travel times have been shortened greatly, thanks to their locations and the importance of Beijing-Guangzhou line. Another factor that contributes most time reductions, especially in the past decade, is the large-scale expansion of China’s high-speed rail network. Therefore, we include a gif map that shows the building of this network, with a special emphasis on railways designed for speeds of 350km/h or above.

This study on network visualization aims to design an efficient recommendation system which enables users to discover a movie based on sentiment words. And we mainly aimed to design a semantic network that minimizes network learning, and to develop a method to easily understand the node groups. Movie review data from online resources were applied in this research, and the process is as follows: 1) Calculated a frequency of sentiment words from each movie review. 2) Designed a Heatmap visualization to effectively discover the main emotions on each online movie review. 3) Formed a Sentiment-Movie Network combining the MDS Map and Social Network in order to fix the movie network topology, while creating a network graph to enable the clustering of similar nodes. 4) Applied the asterism graphic in order to impart the meaning in accordance with the characteristics of clustering for better cognitive interpretation. This research is expected to be adopted in another recommendation system since our method is applicable regardless of the number of review data, and even to other media contents such as web-based cartoons, music, and books, using assorted constellation images related to target field.

Antje Schimke, Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft	Storytelling In a world of global competition, startup ecosystems and their innovators need to build their ventures based upon their core strengths. The depicted comparison of Europe and China not only shows relative strengths of both regions with regard to the full range of technological fields, but also the technological dominance of China in many areas. Leveraging these technologies into future ventures and innovations has enormous potential for welfare and impact. Methodology and Data Methodology is available at WIPO Statistics Database (open source), discussed with IPC and Technology Concordance Table at: http://www.wipo.int/ipstats/en/statistics/patents/pdf/wipo_ipc_technology.pdf. With the help of database PatBase (https://www.patbase.com), we are able to generate technological fields and profiles for each of the entities in terms of patent data. Hence, to gain additional information on the technology fields that are assigned to patents we use the PatBase, which provides information about published patents and its IPC-classes, e.g. technology field information in terms of IPC-classes. The WIPO technology concordance table links the International Patent Classification (IPC) symbols with thirty-five fields of technology. The concordance table is updated on a regular basis to reflect revisions to the IPC. With my method, we introduce a variable counting the total number of technology fields (i.e. IPC 4-digit) that are assigned to patent. Furthermore, the method, by contrast, displays the frequency of how often a technology occurs with different technologies. How does it work? • Classification of all entities in accordance with their technological focal points • Mirroring this with the activities of patenting firms so companies with a similar technological position can be identified • Further development of technology-specific activities and focal points, while observing technological ties, network structure and system dynamics Results and Benefit • Studying the technological focal points of countries (i.e. China and Europe) • Analysis of potential strategic partners and competitors within and between countries • Identifying potential customers and licensees • Identifying technology trends in specific countries • Developing network structures and system dynamics • Potential idea accelerator Fields of action • Benchmarking: Comparing countries and assignees to the technology • Positioning: supporting information for (new) technological orientation • Evaluation of technological ties The entrant has supplied an additional file for this project: [1]	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Longlist;Science & Technology

The Cerberus Plains are located approximately between 1550 E and 1800 E and between the equator and 110 N. To the NW is Elysium Mons, to the S is the Medusae Fossae Formation and to the NE is Amazonis Planitia a section of the northern plains of Mars. This area of Mars has been identified as youngest volcanic plains on Mars. It has been suggested using crater counting methods that the youngest lava surfaces are less than 10 million years old. Mars Images for this Geological Map was obtained from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HIRISE QLOOK images by zooming in and selecting specific areas of interest within the images in the high resolution IAS viewer and then saving the current view to a .jpg file. The .jpg files were then loaded into Adobe Illustrator 9.0 where geological units, faults and features of interest could be mapped by overlaying the images with transparent colour and text. Each colour unit was numbered for clearer location within the geological map from the key. This image is part of a series of 14 maps using HIRISE images as a base. Additionally all maps have also been overlain on a Google Mars Data Elevation Model and using the .kmz file created the user can explore the area themselves in 3D using the navigation features in Google Mars. A PDF file containing all 14 maps can be viewed using the URL in this submission. Evidence has been seen of graben spreading, sharp edges to Fossae Fractures and debris flows associated with faulting. Multiple fault traces were seen within some fractures with truncated debris fans showing fault plains. Faulting also appears to have a directional component as well as vertical to it and further work needs to be carried to measure changes in the directional component.

The magazine hosts and presents stories within a visual narrative that seamlessly mixes video, data, images and other additional contents, enriching his collection of interviewees every week. The video interview of each speaker represents the basis on which all the others' information is overlapped, creating a blend of qualitative contents given by video and words and quantitative contents conveyed by data visualizations. In fact, while telling their stories, the protagonists were asked to highlight important moments and events in time, places where significant situations happened as well as a series of crucial cultural references. All these collected data have then been displayed in three different environments of the interactive platform: a timeline, a map and a system of lists that the user can filter and sort as he prefers. As a visual and dynamic hypertext, viewers will have access to all these further sources of information without stopping to watch the interview. All the stories are dissected into different themes discussed and the viewers can therefore filter and sort the interviews by the theme that interests them the most, composing their own fully customized episode. A dedicated playlist will be generated every time, according to their selection. Colors have a crucial role in the interface, being both a bold stylistic feature and a meaningful element: every interviewee is in fact color coded with a specific nuance, that allows the user to easily recognize him, independently from which view he’s browsing. In Peninsula Talks, interviews are conceived as a collection of different objects that users can combine in multiple ways and that can be discovered in a non-linear fruition, creating an immersive and rich experience for the user and therefore exploring new and innovative solutions for on-line magazines.

3550	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3481-visualizing-i-ching	Visualizing I-Ching	Yvette Shen	This interactive project uses text mining and data visualization techniques to reveal new patterning insights of the ancient Chinese text I-Ching from both divinatory and philosophical perspectives.  The goal of the project is to overcome cultural and language barriers, and investigate more innovative methods to objectively analyze and interpret I-Ching than language translations. The visualization approach and research process explore four aspects of I-Ching: the cyclical dynamic among different fortune stages, the thematic categories of the Decisions, the occurrences of keywords related to divination, and the geometrical patterns of the Hexagrams.  Visualizing abstract text information that is polysemic and sometimes uncertain provides a new way to view and understand I-Ching and Chinese philosophy that can reach to a wide range of audiences. We hope the intuitive feeling viewers get with the abstract symbols makes the comparison among stages of fortune and thematic concerns within or between the Guas (hexagrams) more compelling. At both a micro and a macro level, we intend to develop a new appreciation of I-Ching – as it is a systematic yet still organic structure that expand to support itself as it grows in richness and complexity.

We felt that the organization needed a special data-driven logo to represent the diversity and passion of the membership. We did this by collecting individual survey responses from every member of the society and recording their self-reported expertise into different data visualization related skills across three broad areas. While there’s no absolute metric to measure these qualities, we developed a way to let people rank themselves across 9 categories pertaining to their skills in Data (collection, data cleaning, analysis) Visualization (design, building, storytelling) and Society (project management, community, leadership). To create the main logo for the society, we averaged the responses of entire membership, which highlighted the overall breadth of skills within the membership. Since data visualization touches on many skill sets, and people come to it from different backgrounds, we also wanted to to visualize each member’s unique visualization skills. Each member received a personalized badge—variations on the main logo theme—that represented their own unique responses to the survey questions. Individual members’ badges act like data viz fingerprints, showing which of the skills and disciplines in a data visualizer’s portfolio they most identify with. When looking at collections of individual member badges, trends start to become visible: large teal triangles convey an emphasis on data, a large yellow spike to the upper right is someone with a strong design background, and smaller forms indicate someone might be new to the field and just starting out. The Data Visualization Society logo and badges use individual membership survey data to convey the diversity and breadth of the society’s membership, while still emphasizing the each individual members’ ownership and belonging in this diverse field, as they literally are reflected in the main society logo.

The regularity of the rate and the number of applicants can be used to forecast the trend in the next few years. From the chart, it can be clearly seen that the number of applicants for college entrance examination in each province is closely related to the annual rate of one copy. The more the number of applicants, the lower the rate of one copy, the fewer the number of applicants. The higher the cost is, the ratio x is calculated by dividing the annual data of the two and the average ratio x is calculated. Through a large number of data, we can find the trend of one-book rate and calculate the corresponding one-book rate, multiply one-book rate by ratio X and get the estimated number of applicants.

When you meet your spouse collaborating on data visualization, you have to make data viz part of your wedding. At least, that is how we (Amy Cesal and Zander Furnas) felt. Collaboration has always been a central part of our relationship as it evolved from coworkers, to friends, and ultimately life partners. It was a real joy for us to collaborate on the visualization for our wedding. This project was an unusual design challenge. As an academic researcher and data visualization designer duo, we are used to visualizing data where accuracy is paramount. In this project, we wanted our data visualizations to inspired the specific feelings that we wanted to cultivate at our wedding. In several instances, this meant intentionally choosing impressionistic, evocative design features rather than data-mappings that might facilitate the most technically accurate interpretations. We created a large-format banner for our guests to view as they entered our venue. Weddings are fundamentally about relationships, and a well-designed network visualization can effectively represent small-scale relational data. This social network graph showed how all of our guests knew each other. Weddings can feel socially overwhelming, so we designed the welcome banner to make our guests feel connected to the community we brought together to celebrate. The banner allowed our guests to immediately see who else they knew at the wedding, how everyone knew each other, and get an overall sense of the communities that were important to us. The name badges we designed served double duty by having table assignments on the back with stickers. We made the badges the same size as the circles representing each guest’s node on network (2.5"" diameter), and affixed the badges to the banner. The network map served as the display for badges/table assignments, and the badges served as the labels on the network diagram. Each badge had a heart visual on it, in which each lobe represented the guests relationship to one of us. The size of each lobe indicates the length of the relationship and the color of the lobe indicates the type of relationship (e.g., family friend, family, childhood friend, coworker etc.). However, we were more interested in creating a feeling, than in facilitating minute comparisons of “who has known us longer.” We had to be careful in how we represented comparatively new relationships, because we didn’t want any of our guests to feel minimized by their badges. As a result, some level of obscurity in the design was desirable for our purposes. We set a minimum size for the heart lobes, and applied a non-linear transformation to the length of the relationship to make sure that the badges of guests who we had only recently met still looked fun and welcoming.

He was not only bringing together multiple Doctors, but also a secret incarnation viewers had never seen before, all within one of his trademark time-bending plots. He concluded by saying: ""If you actually break it down, it's the world's most complicated story, ever. Try doing a flowchart of that one!"" So I did. I worked through the story and the characters' movements -- across several time zones as well as places, of course, this being Doctor Who -- and produced a diagram that traced them all through the convoluted events of the story. I started with a rectilinear layout to work out how the characters' paths inter-related while getting them to align with minimal crossovers. For the final version I reworked this into a circular form that allowed the different settings to be connected and mirrored the circulatory nature of the storyline. Intending it for fans who would be familiar with the show, I used recognisable icons and colour for the characters and specific artefacts to make it clear who was where throughout the story without requiring too much text or signposting, as I wanted to keep the character path lines uncluttered and easily traceable."

Yes, we even suffered through the prequels. We took our inspiration from xkcd's hand-drawn movie narrative charts, but our aim was to write code that could adequately replace artist Randall Munroe's illustrations. Our charts show all the scenes from the first six Star Wars movies, mapping out interactions between the characters. Why did we take on this galactic-size mission? Our aim was to make a complex saga digestible and easy to explore. But that isn’t to say complexity doesn’t sometimes help tell the story. Take, for instance, the obvious visual difference in our charts between the original Star Wars trilogy and the prequels. Our charts suggest the original films have a relatively simple structure: they centre on a handful of key characters and follow their adventures as they fight 'the dark side'. The prequels see a proliferation of characters, and unfortunately that includes Jar Jar Binks! Our charts demonstrate how George Lucas’s movie-making style changed from the originals to the prequels, and show the latter have a much more complicated structure. Finally, our charts are just plain fun for fans. They can relive the journey of their favourite characters, pinpoint the moment they fell in love with Hans Solo, and track Jar Jar Binks’s slide into obscurity.

3587	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3085-sing-it-along-the-world	Sing It Along the World	Leah Xinyan Jin	A visualization of national anthems in the world. Nowadays, a massive amount of data about the economy, education, environment, history, etc. were put together to recognize a country. A national anthem is a different and unique feature. It is a medium that the country endeavors to define itself and to spread it out and loud. It shows not only the country’s identity, history, ideology, but also the prospect the country is desired to achieve in the future. It is a manifesto. From left to right, top to bottom, each square represents the anthem of one country alphabetically, with a total of 190 countries included. Three variables (sound waves and lengths of anthems, the most used works in lyrics) are taken into this visualization. The black and white backgrounds of squares represent sound waves of national anthems. The curves are responding to the pitch and frequency levels of the songs; where the lines between black and white go faded and blurred means where the audio fades gradually; where lines go sharp and clean means where the audio has a sudden change in pitch or frequency. Sizes of circles represent lengths of songs; colors of circles represent categories in which most used words such as “freedom”, “people”, etc. It is interesting to see the difference in repetitive words in every country’s anthem. The most used kind of words in 190 total nations are pronouns.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Longlist;Arts, Entertainment & Culture

The design is intended to take the reader through a narrative of understanding the future of Meat; due to Earth’s immanent population increase and growing red meat consumption, we need to rethink how we produce and approach consuming meat. Through detailing the process of in-vitro meat as an alternative system whilst comparing to traditional meat production the reader is encouraged to make their own decision about a viable future meat option when considering the future, and whether they would be interested in backing the alternative. Followed by a series of data visualisations to give a wider overview of the implications of meat production versus in-vitro and the environmental impacts both scenarios have. There is a speculative response to this project’s data at the end of the document where visualisations about future everyday scenarios within a website and supermarket touch-screens forms were added to the narrative to place the data interpretations into a real-life space in a context which is relatable and allows the reader to bring to life within their day-to-day the possibilities of meat interaction.

3601	https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/2067-data-that-feels-gravity	Data that feels gravity.	Volker Schweisfurth	"Here are data that feel gravity. This presented physical object offers ""statistics at your fingertips"". Such objects make data more exciting that are worthwhile to be remembered and circulated. Object: It represents 130 countries with their key economic data, grouped by continents (left: The America´s, middle: Europe (background) and Africa, right: Asia). From top, you see the Gross National Income sizes (GNI, PPP (current international $)) of the different countries; take this as the countries´potentials. From the side, you see the blocks´ heights- they show the difficulty ranking in realising investments. A short block is a small country with difficult investment conditions. On the 3D printed models´ upper surfaces I put graphic clips that show the countries´ future population pyramids for year 2030 and in some cases also for 2050. The combination of the three incorporated types of information ( economy, investment hurdles, future population ) delivers a vivid narrative of the nations´ situation and fate. Context: The physical representation of data has 7000 years of tradition. The Sumerians used pieces of clay to represent units of measure; native Micronesians made physical visualizations that showed ocean swell patterns to facilitate canoe navigation… I want to show that in our digital age, the cultural technique to create tangible “data landscapes” can be recharged with the help of 3D printing. It is also important to underline that the amount and volatility of strategic data that is constantly disseminated digitally invites new hybrid forms, i.e.more durable supplements, also to establish new narratives. Claim: Let me emphasise that physical data modeling as a form of “slow” and sustainable information must not left to architects and urban planners. Data modeling can offer insights and additional sensory values (touch them, hand them round, watch them at eye level, feel the surface haptics) or, as Robert Polidori, Canadian photographer mentioned “Digital data is made to forget, analogue is made to remember”.

It's a crescent shape that starts in southeastern Virginia and curves around the Carolinas and Georgia inland of the coast before cutting through Alabama and Mississippi and bleeding into the lower Mississippi Valley. There's an explanation for this shape that stretches back into America's dark past and beyond in geologic time. That crescent was once the coastline of the southeast, and as a result the soil there is extremely fertile and good for growing cotton. The land was used for that purpose, and many slaves were brought there ... today many of the descendants of those slaves still live in those areas, and as rural blacks, face racism, economic deprivation and poor education. Those socioeconomic factors account for the heightened mortality rates visible in the so-called Black Belt. The story associated with this work explores the realities of the Black Belt today. The interactive is the most comprehensive presentation of mortality rates in the U.S. anywhere. Based on a model developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the maps include every county, over 60 causes of death, and every year from 1980 to 2014. That's over 2,100 maps.

I was curious to see if there was a trend between what kinds of people were chosen to be included as subjects. However, for a book about work, Working mentions few numeric figures.

Among these, I recorded age (either given or estimated from birth year and approximate time of writing), years working, sex and their apparent fulfillment with their work. These charts represent my findings and include only subjects who disclosed all criteria.

Because they wanted to show the power of wildlife data collection, they asked us to visually tell the stories of elephants, lions and wildebeests in Tanzania and Kenia, based on real data. We decided to create three short documentaries about the animals, in which we would visualize their ways of living and coping with changing environments. By doing this, we helped Internet of Elephants to create more awareness for their mission. First, we collected the data from organizations that equipped wild animals with GPS-trackers. Then we searched for interesting patterns in the data, by analyzing and comparing the different migration patterns. We then presented the data to conservationists, who provided us with more context and expertise. After selecting the data from three different types of animals (lions, wildebeests and elephants), we created storyboards. Finally, using height maps and satellite images of the locations, we recreated the landscapes in 3D, on which we plotted the data. By visualizing animal migration patterns and behavior through data-driven animations, we demonstrate the power of data in the field of wildlife preservation.

Caixin Media Company Limited	This is a mobile friendly data visualization project produced for the World’s No-Tobacco Day. 11670 items were scraped from the world cigarette website, including package image and fundamental tobacco introduction. For the project lead, animation storytelling was used to explain WHO’s guidelines of standard cigarette packaging. And then all Chinese packages were released to show the strong contrast between the reality and the guideline. Then, the main tone for each package was extracted with Python Image Library. Tobacco Package colors of different regions were collected and compared. Chinese packages, red and gold, stand out, which runs counter to WHO’s standards. In the main page, spectrums of cigarettes packages can be clicked, and the corresponding package will show. In the Chinese version people can even see the name detail of each cigarette. Besides the color, we also analyzed the graph content on packages with sampling. Through comparing the contents of Chinese and the States’ packages samples, it’s clear that Chinese packages design prefer the great scene views, like Mt. Huang, the Great Wall and so on. By clicking each genre, readers can see the sample packages of each one. This report reminded people’s awareness of the smoking ban in an unusual way. We believe that the best outcome of visualization is to connect cold raw data with the warmth of real life.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2017	Unusual

Instead of talking to the pundits, The Economist listened to the data. Specifically, we looked at the president's economic performance in the 18 months prior to election day, and compared that against every postwar presidential re-election bid -- both successful and failed. As for what it showed? In absolute terms, Obama's economic record resembled bids that lost, pocked by high unemployment and low GDP growth. However more importantly, seen as trend lines, his performance more closely resembled successful bids -- an interpretation that was vindicated when Obama won.

Using a simple pixel-difference math bot, this map isolates places where lights have come on (or increased) and where they have gone off (or decreased) in the past five or so years. There are lots of interesting changes to the nighttime sky in these last recent years. Some optimistic and exciting, and others terribly sad. In the map’s text I lay out some hunches for what might cause lights to come on in some places and some reasons I suspect for lights that have been extinguished. Some reasons for new nighttime illumination are suburban growth rings around existing urban centers, the new electrification of rural areas, wellhead fires in areas of new petroleum extraction, or waters newly popular with fisheries. Some reasons for dimmed or extinguished nighttime illumination are the preventative measures taken to reduce nighttime light pollution, the contraction of populations from economically struggling areas, the abandonment of petroleum fields or fisheries, or the collapse of population or infrastructure due to war or social upheaval.

We picked 8 major emerging countries to show the nuances of who is using the internet (adults 18+), what activities the internet is primarily used for, and how internet usage affects different populations. By drawing links between user perceptions of the internet’s influence and popular online activities, we painted a multi-dimensional picture of how internet usage impacts well-being in these emerging countries.

Riders have been flirting with unheard of speeds during descents, touching 70 miles an hour. And race organizers have been responding with more challenging mountain stages than ever. The past four editions of the Tour all featured at least 11 downhill sections so steep that the road lost 50 meters in vertical elevation per kilometer. Ten of the descents in this summer’s race are even stiffer, averaging at least a 6% downhill, including the notoriously technical Col d’Allos in the race’s final week.

Playing with the Wikipedia common definition of a mandala; this graphic is essentially a geometric attempt to symbolize or represent the microcosm of a local climate cosmos. The project started as a creative effort to represent the local climate of Salt Spring Island, which lies in the heart of the Salish Sea in the Pacific North West of Canada and US. It combines 5 year averages of weather data from a local weather station on the roof of the Gulf Islands Secondary School in the town of Ganges, Salt Spring Island BC. The station is part of school based weather station network that is sponsored by the University of Victoria, BC, that is utilized as both an educational and local/micro climate research resource. 5 year daily averages of selected weather measurements are displayed radially in time, with summer at the top and winter at the bottom. Solar insolation and precipitation are represented by yellow and blue circles respectively with the diameter of the circles representing relative quantities, and their plotted distance from the center of the circle representing relative daily temperatures. Green circles represent relative humidity also plotted on a relative temperature scale. Daily average wind speeds are represented by the indigo ellipses and plotted on a relative atmospheric pressure scale with higher pressure being farther from the center.

And it turns out that these programs were not only fun to watch, they actually help young children learn. Children under the age of 5 who watch Sesame Street have a 16% higher GPA in high school, express less aggressive attitudes, and score better on a wide range of achievement measurements. Kids under the age of 5 learn at astounding rates - forming 700 neural connections per second. And the effect of providing children under the age of 5 with high quality education is overwhelmingly positive. By age 40, adults who attended high-quality preschools were more likely to have graduated high school, held a job, owned a home, and earn a higher income. Children from underprivileged households are even harder hit. We worked with Sesame Street to make the case for investing in early childhood education and to highlight some of the achievements they have already made in this realm. With toys, fur, and colorful paper, we help shed light on the importance of early childhood education to bridge the readiness gap, and ultimately transform society.

This research-based artwork has an experimental system generating distinct sounds for the iris data using visual features such as colors, patterns, brightness and size of the iris. It has potential to lead to a new way of interpreting complicated datasets with audiovisual output. More importantly; aesthetically beautiful, mesmerizing and a bit uncanny valley-affected artwork can create personalized art experiences and multimodal interaction.

A data-driven digital experience visualizing “soft” and “human” data to discover the world’s interest in the 2016 US presidential candidates. By looking at searches for each candidate and how they differ in each country, WorldPOTUS shows real-time worldwide variations in searches — and which region is interested in each of the major election issues. The topics — Abortion, Black Lives Matter, Brexit, Economy, Foreign Policy, Global Warming, Gun Control, Healthcare, ISIS, Oil, Racism, Refugees, Same Sex Marriage, TPP — are selected based on the top issues of the campaign as decided by their ranking in Google search on average in 2016. But, why these wobbly bubbles? Shouldn’t data visualization always be rigorous and precise? The Google Trends Index is a valuable and insightful way to gauge the general sense of a country’s interest in a topic over time, but it shouldn't be considered a perfect and ultimate measure of it. Opinions on such delicate topics are often a fluid and ever-changing blob and, for this reason, Accurat worked on a “softer” depiction of data, in a way, that faithfully renders the fluidity and fuzziness of conversations around the world – a deliberately imperfect visual to grasp and display a meaningful and rich, but very human, dataset.

(Blue=negative words, Red=positive words). The contrast in this image between the “scientific” and “theological” shows an unresolved conflict between these two communities on the origins of the universe. Whether the viewer is a believer or not, it highlights the differing and sometimes conflicting messages within the text and how it ends with a more positive message. It is perhaps analogous to how the differing views in the scientific process cause it to achieve a greater understanding of nature though proving and disproving various theories, eventually resulting in a positive net understanding of the universe. The full text of the King James bible (taken from https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases) displayed top to bottom with a break inserted between old and new testaments. The color is a form of sentiment analysis, in that the word being compared has a score of visual similarity with known positive or negative words (taken from http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html and references therein). Each word has a score, for example the word “cherry” is visually similar to the positive word “cheer” and also the negative word “cheat” though the sentiment of “cherry” is entirely separate from either. As each word is added with a wide spread, it has a diffuse impact of the sentiment of the text. As well as showing up the use of recognized negative/positive words, the style of writing and the naturally available vocabulary can also be seen. The changes in subject matter and authorship can also be picked out. The color-table was adapted from the original cosmic microwave background https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap061007.html measured by the COBE mission (http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/: launched 1989).

It provides visual information on the athletes and their respective data in 5 parts - the results by sport, anthropometrics, country, skill and history. The project was created in reaction to the fact that women’s sport receives approximately 5% of media coverage and that this coverage has a tendency to value aesthetics over athletics. In addition to this, historically there has been very little anthropological data collected about female athletes. The purpose of the project is to represent female athletes as positive role models as well as showing the athletic potential of women by celebrating diversity in body types. To do this, each gold medalist and therefore each sporting event are given equal coverage. Girls cannot be what they cannot see and what they generally see during the coverage of the Olympics is dominated by the ‘feminine’ sports such as gymnastics, swimming, diving and beach volleyball. Specific physical traits vital to elite sport are found in a wide range of body types. This diversity is remarkable and exactly what should be embraced. It provides an opportunity for girls and young women, to find empowerment through the many benefits of participation. The information is provided in five parts: Part 1 - Results by event. Arranged by sport from A-Z, the athletes are illustrated on a datum with their respective name, nationality, anthropometric data and event(s). Part 2 - Anthropometric data. The athletes are represented, by age height and weight. Part 3 - Skill. Each sport is rated based on 10 skills. Part 4 - Country. Gold medalists by country and sport. Part 5 - History. Infographic of women’s inclusion in the Olympics. The design process starts with collecting data on each athlete from the Rio website. Reference images of the athletes competing were found online. Each athlete is illustrated in the same pose wearing the uniform they were wearing in the event that earned them their gold medal. Given that their faces are left intentionally blank, many individuating details are represented. These include, body shape, skin colour, hair style, footwear, eye wear, support bandages and accessories. The vector style of illustration was chosen as it is universally engaging, informational and a departure from the depiction of female athletes as sexual objects.

This is fun way of educating people in how to navigate data. The classic game ""Guess Who"" has been recreated and as questions are answered the data is evaluated and colour is used to show not only if the answer is correct, but how data is associated with the answer (green), disassociated (grey) and what possible data remains to explore. Ultimately this is a data literacy tool that uses a familiar game to emphasise the ease at which data can be explored by anyone of any skill and experience. It also highlights the importance of the ""grey"" because using a linear approach to data preparation removes data from view, whereas the ""grey"" allows you to see what is not associated and check for issues in the data.

To harness the power of visual social media, Kantar Added Value has developed Social Watching. Social Watching is a unique approach that uses image recognition technology, semiotic analysis, and the collection of user-generated content at scale to transform the way brands think about their brand’s equity. By analysing the visual content users are generating, we can give brand owners and their agencies unfiltered insight into how their brand is being engaged with, and an understanding of the lives of the people they serve. We have developed a tool that is able to analyse user-generated content at scale; taking hundreds of thousands of images and converting them into an easy-to-navigate, insightful and meaningful window on the world. Through using wordless maps and charts, the platform can help you to navigate user-generated content in simple and impactful way and export it into a presentation easily. If a picture is worth a thousand words, and this platform can analyse hundreds of thousands, then there is an enormous opportunity here. The potential of this tool is manifold; it has the ability to flex and change to client needs, and be a real problem solver when it comes to navigating visual data at scale. Through its ability to boil down a chaotic visual world into something visually simple, we believe this could play a significant role in the future of our industry.

Taking on neuroscience with a dash of educational theory, this infographic mirrors some of the styles seen in Scientific American to distill a complex topic into a highly interactive stroll around the brain. Hover and explore to see what both the preliterate and literate brains think when presented with the task of deciphering 2 letters. Using study data, it also highlights the mechanics of how we learn to read and the various tasks we achieve in developing literacy. It shows, based on longitudinal observations, when these tasks are typically achieved. From there, small multiples help highlight what each area does. Hover for the technical name of the area and more detail. By the end of the visualization, we can see all the areas that are engaged. The literate brain tethers an alphabet-driven language to phonetic sounds, using common language zones and creating a Visual Word Form Area within the brain.

Katie Coughlan	"I have always loved Disney and Pixar movies, growing up with classics like Toy Story and Finding Nemo. Watching these as a girl, I was mostly oblivious to the similarities between women characters. I recently read this article by Isis Madrid which references a Tumblr post by Every Flavored Bean, claiming that nearly every female character in Disney Pixar movies has basically the same face.  I believe that Madrid raises some valid points in her article. After looking at her readers' comments, however, I was appalled at how many people thought her words were absurd. The vast majority of comments did one of three things: justified Disney for infantilizing female faces, claimed that Madrid left too many female characters out of her research that disprove her argument, or accused feminists of ""finding something else to complain about"".  I decided to do some detailed research for myself, and find out if female Disney Pixar characters' faces, in fact, all look the same. I started by gathering images of every character (male and female) listed on IMDB.com in each of the Disney Pixar full-length feature films made from 1995 to 2015.

In dozens of cities a type of clearance intended to be the exception to the rule has become the rule for rape cases.   We requested clearance data from the internal case management systems of every police jurisdiction in the country serving a population of 300,000 or more. 64 agencies provided us with detailed records of each case and how it was cleared.

A yearly festival is devoted to the film and its slacker-hero ""the Dude,"" where legions of fans gather to share in their love of all things Lebowski. Interested readers have mountains of material to peruse, with something for everyone: ""The Tao of the Dude"" for philosophers; ""The Year's Work in Lebowski Studies"" for the scholarly minded; ""Collected Recipes of the Dude"" for cooks and mixologists. The tangled and meandering plot (inspired by Raymond Chandler's notoriously confusing 'The Big Sleep') features a kidnapping scheme, a missing ransom, elusive rewards, and MacGuffins upon MacGuffins. One can watch the film numerous times without fully grasping how the various plot threads tie together — if they do at all. In sum, the world of 'The Big Lebowski' is eclectic, diffuse, and supersaturated. Its plot, its soundtrack, its cast of characters, and their conversations: these elements are not centered and uniform but diverse and divergent. As Lebowski fans might put it, there is no rug that ties the room together. How, then, might viewers orient themselves within the film? This visualization provides a means of exploring this question, for those who are devoted fans, casually acquainted with the film, or simply interested in visual representations of temporal forms. It maps the film's music, dialogue, characters, and settings and shows how its plot structure is articulated through these elements. The aim is not to ""reveal"" a single coherent structure beneath the film's chaotic surface, but rather to suggest multiple ways to find one's bearings, and to allow users to discover their own ways of navigating and making sense of this richly textured film."

This visualization allows one to quickly see distribution. Trees in the Bronx and Manhattan seem to be distributed more uniformly compared to the other three boroughs. With such high concentrations of certain trees, there is a risk of a pathogen, insect or environmental stress wiping out a large amount of trees. Also a sizable percentage of trees have been marked “unknown” in the dataset, making the dataset incomplete. Trees have been grouped by genus.

Influenza, or 'the flu', causes the most illnesses in the colder, winter months. However, an outbreak of swine flu, H1N1, in the spring and into the fall of 2009. This outbreak dramatically changed the pattern of the disease that year.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2019	Longlist;Science & Technology

In addition, I led my students to do the self evaluation and show the result in infographic. Combining the datas and feedback from other art academies, I found that during the design learning process, it is easier for male students to accept the new concepts and they are more active to learn design knowledge and skills comparing to female students."

Yet more chains are filing for bankruptcy and rated distressed than during the financial crisis. E-commerce is just a small part of the problem; the root cause is that many of these long-standing chains are overloaded with debt, which has caused an increase in the number of delinquent loan payments by malls and shopping centers. This debt coming due, along with America’s over-stored suburbs and the continued gains of online shopping, has all the makings of a disaster. The spillover will likely flow far and wide across the U.S. economy. There will be displaced low-income workers, shrinking local tax bases and investor losses on stocks, bonds and real estate. If today is considered a retail apocalypse, then what’s coming next could truly be scary. We took a detailed look at this subject from every angle: store closings, delinquent commercial loans, retail bankruptcies, consumer confidence, unemployment, wages and retail jobs concentration. With a wealth of data at our disposal, the best and most helpful graphical forms were chosen for each aspect of this story. All of these maps and charts aid the reporting to form the most comprehensive chronicle of America’s retail apocalypse.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Politics & Global;Longlist

Charles Hutton	"The 'Map of Every City' is a study of history, the urban fabric, personal experience and gentrification applied to the medium of a traditional city street map. Through its universality, it encompasses all cities, becoming what is essentially an all-in-one city map. By replacing place names with non-specific descriptions, city areas are reduced to cliched, recognisable enclaves unhitched to any specific time or place, while references to memories of gentrification change give the map a historical depth. The map can therefor be applied to people's experience of any number of cities. A large version of the map was produced as part of the advertising for the book ""A Sticky Note Guide to Life"" - this version of the map included empty sections that could be filled in by the public with their own memories or experiences."

If that AQI did not fall below .054 parts per million (ppm), it is considered a ""not good"" day. All of those ""not good"" days were then compared to all daily measurements taken in each county to determine the % of bad days a particular county experienced by year and season.

I decided to compare this data point against the most famous artists in hip hop. I used each artist’s first 35,000 lyrics. That way, prolific artists, such as Jay-Z, could be compared to newer artists, such as Drake.  My inspiration for the project was pretty simple: I had a full database from rapgenius.com, a lyrics site, containing over 65,000 hip hop songs. I had just learned D3, a data visualization framework, and read the Natural Language Toolkit book (the first chapter describes how to calculate the unique words in a corpus). I used a research methodology called token analysis to determine each artist’s vocabulary. Each word is counted once, so pimps, pimp, pimping, and pimpin are four unique words. To avoid issues with apostrophes (e.g., pimpin’ vs. pimpin), they’re removed from the dataset.	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2014	Shortlist;Longlist;Gold;Winners;Winners;Data visualization

So, it doesn't really matter if your opinion matches 50% or 75%, you vote for the complete package of opinions of that party . This means that it is valuable to get a sense of overview: how does this party differ from the others? Does it have unique positions?

They have been participating with their own national football team or were a part of a constituted country. Also most African countries were still colonized by another country during the first half of the last century.  The reasons a country did not participate at a tournament or more are various: They didn’t qualify, they withdrew for some (political) reason, they were banned, their entry wasn’t accepted by FIFA, they weren’t affiliated with FIFA or they simply didn’t enter. With a moderate knowledge of modern history you can tell what some absences of concerning countries were caused by. Next to this I found it interesting to have some insight in which countries performed best: winning the Cup or end up second, third or fourth. I added a small top 10 World Cup soccer teams, which isn’t about who won most but who gained the most points during World Cup tournaments.  * at this moment, including Quatar which as the host is qualified for 2022	Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2018	Shortlist;Longlist;Leisure, Games & Sport

Hands-on, honest and condensed.   We’ve been working in the field of infographics and visual information for over half a decade now. Every single day we turn data and information into powerful visual communication. We’ve failed. We’ve succeeded. But most importantly, we’ve learned. At some point we started to compile all the most important lessons we’ve learned in a little notebook – as a way to get smarter and make sure we didn’t repeat the same mistakes over and over. A few notes quickly became a lot, and this notebook was born.   Basically, the notebook details everything you need to consider when working with information design: lessons learned, insights and dos & don’ts. Based on our own experiences, we wanted to create useful, hands-on advice in a digestible format. We use the notebook ourselves in our daily work. So this notebook also gives you the opportunity to benefit from our all the lessons we have learned and become a better information designer.

We analyzed polls and discovered a pattern connecting infightings with voter approval. Along the polls we tell the parties young history in an interactive chronicle. One can divide it in three phases of three different party leaders, showing a similar pattern in the development of polls and events: At the beginning of each phase, the party occupies a topic with ""alternative"" positions, goes up in the polls with an attitude of protest against government policy - and falls back again as a result of a power struggle within the party that ends with the more right positioned winning the infight. Small multiples, sorted geographically, show the AfD polls in the individual federal states in comparison to the nationwide poll average. These and the last chart show that the party's voter support in East and West has drifted farther apart than ever before: While the AfD initially gained popularity in eastern and western states, the polls in eastern countries are now well above the national average, while they are stagnating in the west.
